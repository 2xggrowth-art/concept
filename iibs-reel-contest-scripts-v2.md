## V2 vs V1 — WHAT CHANGED

| V1 Problem | V2 Fix |
|-----------|--------|
| Hooks were people TALKING | Hooks are people DOING — riding, crashing, garlanding, wheelie-ing |
| No actual BCH products visible | Every script features real products by NAME |
| Could be about any brand | Pocket bike = BCH-only asset, impossible to copy |
| Classroom/office setups | Full campus used — gate, parking, corridors, grounds, night |
| Generic price comparisons | Products ARE the content — you see them, want them |
| 6-7 people standing around | 6-7 people all in MOTION with different roles |
