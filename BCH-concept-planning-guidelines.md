# STEP 1: KNOW YOUR CONTENT TYPE

Before writing anything, decide which track this concept belongs to.

| | CONVERSION Content (70% of output) | ENTERTAINMENT Content (30% of output) |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Store visits, DMs, sales | Reach, brand awareness, shares |
| **Hook type** | TG's real daily-life pain point | Genre-mismatch, absurd metaphor |
| **Structure** | Hook → Value → Value → Price → CTA | Hook → Story → Punchline → BCH appears naturally |
| **Example** | Kid's chain snaps → e-cycle = no chain → Rs. 999/month → "DM us CYCLE" | Kid writes breakup letter to PS5 for an e-cycle |
| **Metrics that matter** | Saves, DMs, store visits | Views, shares, reach |
| **Length** | 30-60 seconds | 15-30 seconds |

**The priority is always CONVERSION content.** Entertainment builds the brand, conversion pays the bills.

---
---

# STEP 2: IDENTIFY YOUR TARGET GROUP (TG)

Before a single word is written, answer these 5 questions. If you can't answer ALL 5 clearly, stop — you don't have a concept yet.

| # | Question | What a Good Answer Looks Like |
|---|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | **WHO exactly is this for?** | A specific person — "14-year-old Bangalore kid whose cycle chain keeps breaking" or "38-year-old mother who checks screen time every night." NOT just "parents" or "kids." |
| 2 | **What DAILY LIFE moment does this come from?** | Something the TG has ACTUALLY LIVED THROUGH — chain snap, screen time guilt, kid asking for a ride to school, auto fare frustration. NOT a random dramatic scenario. |
| 3 | **What will they FEEL?** | Name a HIGH-AROUSAL emotion: amusement, surprise, anxiety, pride, envy, guilt. NOT sadness, calm, or acceptance (low-arousal emotions kill action). |
| 4 | **What will they DO after watching?** | A SPECIFIC action — "Send to spouse," "Save for weekend visit," "Show to kid," "DM us 'CYCLE'." NOT "think about us." |
| 5 | **Can you describe it in ONE SENTENCE that makes someone laugh or say "wait, what"?** | If yes → you have a concept. If no → simplify until you can. |

### The Tata Ace Lesson (MEMORIZE THIS)

A lady acted like she was in a bike accident under a Tata Ace. Crowd gathered. She said she rushed because BCH has offers. Got ~3 million views. **ZERO enquiries. ZERO conversions.**

**Lesson:** A strong hook + wrong audience = wasted content. The hook attracted rubberneckers, not cycle buyers. **Every hook must attract the RIGHT person, not just ANY person.**

---

### TG Life-Event Hook Method (How to Find the Right Hook)

1. **Identify the TG** → parent, teenager, commuter, cyclist
2. **Map their REAL daily life events** → first crush, chain snap, screen time fight, auto fare frustration, kid tantrums, fuel bills
3. **Pick ONE specific event they've ACTUALLY lived through**
4. **Exaggerate it** → make it dramatic, funny, larger-than-life
5. **Connect it to the product NATURALLY** → not forcefully, not cringe

| TG | Daily Life Moment → Hook |
|---|---|
| **Kids 10-16** | Chain snaps mid-ride → frustration → "There's a cycle with no chain" |
| **Kids 10-16** | Gets overtaken walking to school → envy → "What if you were the one overtaking?" |
| **Parents (mothers)** | Checking screen time at night → guilt → "What if this number was ZERO?" |
| **Parents (fathers)** | Auto fare adding up → frustration → show monthly auto cost vs EMI |
| **Budget parents** | Kid asks for something expensive → stress → "Rs. 999/month. Less than your daily chai." |

**WARNING:** This can easily become cringe or manipulatively salesy. Test with the Chai Test (Step 7) — would someone mention this concept casually over tea?

---
---

# STEP 3: DESIGN THE 4 HOOK LAYERS (First 3-5 Seconds)

Every concept MUST have ALL 4 hook layers designed explicitly. Not just one. All four.

| # | Hook Layer | What It Is | Example |
|---|-----------|------------|---------|
| 1 | **VISUAL Hook** | A physical, dramatic ACTION that stops the scroll. The body does something dramatic before the mouth says anything. | Kid throws old cycle → it breaks into 4 pieces → puts FIRE on it. (4-5 seconds of pure physical action.) |
| 2 | **SPOKEN / Audio Hook** | A bold opening line that grabs the ear. Emotionally charged, confrontational, or absurd. | "Sir, I spoiled my own kid." / "She rejected you because you ride a local cycle." |
| 3 | **ON-SCREEN TEXT Hook** | Text overlay that creates a curiosity gap. Short (5-7 words max). | "He hasn't touched his phone in 14 days" / "Rs. 33/day" |
| 4 | **SFX Hook** | Sound effect, editing trick, or audio punch that amplifies the moment. | Record scratch, dramatic bass drop, glass breaking sound, slow-mo whoosh |

### What a Visual Hook IS:

- A **PHYSICAL, DRAMATIC ACTION** — breaking, fire, throwing, slamming, destruction, shocking gesture
- Happens in 1-4 seconds, BEFORE the concept even starts
- Makes you FEEL something — shock, danger, curiosity, "what the hell is happening?"
- Props are simple (water, match, old cycle, fire) but the ACTION is extreme
- It's NOT clever wordplay, split screens, phone screens, or slow reveals — it's **RAW PHYSICAL ENERGY**

### What a Hook is NOT:

- Random dramatic scenario (heist, surveillance) that has nothing to do with TG's life
- Generic shock value (screaming, jumping) that could be about ANY product
- A phone screen, text chat, or subtitle — the viewer is ALREADY on a phone, another phone screen doesn't interrupt
- A posed setup or still frame — stillness ≠ action

### Hook Scoring Rule

**Score every pattern interruption visual hook 0-10.** If below 8, reject and redo. Always include the score when writing concepts.

### The Hook Must Work for BOTH Followers AND Non-Followers

The Instagram algorithm shows your reel to followers first (first 30 minutes), then expands to non-followers. The hook must stop a **RANDOM PERSON who has never heard of BCH** — not just existing fans.

---
---

# STEP 4: BUILD THE BODY (Value Every 3-5 Seconds)

### The Rules:

1. **Hook → Body must be SEAMLESS.** The body extends the hook naturally. No disconnect. If the hook is "chain snaps," the body must be about chain-free e-cycles. If the hook is "screen time guilt," the body must be about kids going outside.
2. **Every 3-5 seconds = NEW value.** Not repeated value. NEW information, new use case, new price point, new pain point solved, new feature.
3. **Entertainment wrapper is mandatory** but must SERVE the TG and the product — not be random.
4. **The human brain remembers the FIRST and LAST parts.** The middle gets compressed. So the body must fight for attention every few seconds.

### Value Stacking — What Counts as New Value:

| Value Type | Example |
|---|---|
| Price/cost comparison | "Rs. 7 for 100 km" |
| Use case | "Takes kid to school and back on one charge" |
| Pain point solved | "No chain = no chain snap" |
| Social proof | "12 people drove from Bellari just to buy this" |
| Feature demo | "Watch it fold in half" |
| Emotional payoff | "Look at his face when he sees it" |
| Scarcity/urgency | "Only 3 left at this price" |

### BAD (repetitive):
- Second 0: "This cycle is amazing"
- Second 5: "This cycle is really great"
- Second 10: "You'll love this cycle"

### GOOD (stacking):
- Second 0: "This cycle costs Rs. 7 per 100 km" (cost)
- Second 5: "It folds in half" [demonstrates] (portability)
- Second 10: "My kid hasn't touched his phone in 2 weeks" (behavior change)
- Second 15: "EMI is less than Netflix" (affordability reframe)

### The Body Must Include ONE Clear Line:

**"PROMOTING: [feature/product/service/offer]."**

What exactly are we selling in this reel? If you can't name it, the reel has no conversion path.

### The MVP Formula (Benchmark: One Video Sold 50-60 Lakh)

For conversion reels, this is the proven flow:

```
SECOND 0-3:   BOLD STATEMENT ("This is not a cycle, it's a Stream of Rad electric cycle")
SECOND 3-8:   USE CASE (Can be taken to office, school, multi-purpose)
SECOND 8-15:  PRICE (Better than online/offline — specific number, specific comparison)
SECOND 15-22: VALUE STACK (Free gifts, free delivery, free accessories)
SECOND 22-30: STRONG CTA (Clear, single action)
```

---
---

# STEP 5: DESIGN THE CTA (Call To Action)

### The CTA Formula — Use on EVERY Video:

**Signature Phrase + Behavioral Trigger + Location + Deadline + DM Keyword**

| Component | What It Is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Signature Phrase** | The SAME line at the end of EVERY video. Repetition builds neural pathways. After 50 videos = involuntary recall. | "Electric cycle kaafi nahi — BCH chahiye." |
| **Behavioral Trigger** | Ties the CTA to a daily-life moment so the viewer thinks of BCH next time they encounter it. | "Next time you see a petrol bill, screenshot it and DM us." / "Next time your kid asks for screen time, remember — there's a better option at BCH Jayanagar." |
| **Location** | Always end with the PHYSICAL location. Makes it REAL, not just another online brand. | "BCH Jayanagar" |
| **Deadline** | Urgency. A reason to act NOW, not "someday." | "Walk in before Sunday. After that, full price." |
| **DM Keyword** | One word per series. Makes the action dead simple (one word to type). Lets you track which series converts. | DM 'GONE' / DM 'BIRTHDAY' / DM 'CYCLE' |

### 6 CTA Types (Mix and Match):

| Type | Example |
|---|---|
| **A. Signature Phrase** (on EVERY video) | "Electric cycle kaafi nahi — BCH chahiye." |
| **B. Behavioral Trigger** | "Next time you see a petrol bill, screenshot it and DM us." |
| **C. Social Proof** | "1200 families in Bangalore already switched." |
| **D. Identity CTA** | "Good parents don't let their kids ride boring cycles." |
| **E. Scarcity + Location** (highest conversion) | "BCH Jayanagar. Walk in before Sunday. After that, full price." |
| **F. DM Keyword** (for tracking) | "DM 'CYCLE' for details." |

### For Series with a Consistent CTA (e.g., Gone in 30):

Use the SAME CTA on ALL reels in the series. Same words, same delivery. Creates cumulative urgency — constant scratching in the viewer's mind.

---
---

# STEP 6: DESIGN SHARE & COMMENT TRIGGERS

Every concept MUST have a built-in reason for the viewer to SHARE or COMMENT. If neither exists, the concept fails.

### Content Success Hierarchy:

1. **Maximum SHARES** = best content (viewer thinks "someone needs to see this") — triggers DM algorithm boost
2. **Maximum COMMENTS** = very good content (viewer compelled to respond) — triggers engagement algorithm
3. **Just views, zero engagement** = pointless content — why was it even shot?

### Share Triggers (Design These INTO the Script):

| Trigger | When to Insert | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| **"This is literally you"** | After showing a relatable TG moment | Kid's chain snapping → every kid who rides sends this to their friend |
| **"Bro look at this price"** | After price reveal | "Rs. 999/month" → people forward deals to family |
| **"My friend needs this"** | After showing a problem being solved | Parent struggling with screen time → sends to other parents |
| **"This is hilarious"** | After the comedy peak | Mass Series → people share movie-reference comedy |
| **Caption CTA** | End of caption | "Tag a parent who needs to see this" |

### Save Triggers:

| Trigger | When to Insert | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| **"I'll need this later"** | After specific price/offer info | "Save this — weekend offer only" |
| **"I want to show my spouse"** | After convincing use case | Product demo with EMI info |
| **"I need to compare"** | After comparison content | "E-cycle vs auto: 3-year cost" |

---

# STEP 7: RUN THE 6 KILL TESTS

Before anything gets approved, it MUST pass all 6. No exceptions.

| # | Test | How to Check | Pass? |
|---|------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | **One-Sentence Test** | Describe it in one sentence. Does it make someone laugh or go "wait, what?" If no → kill it. | |
| 2 | **DM Test** | Would someone send this to a SPECIFIC person? Who? What's the DM message? If no one comes to mind → kill it. | |
| 3 | **Chai Test** | Could someone describe this Reel to a friend over chai? Would "BCH" or "e-cycle" be in the retelling? If not → kill it. | |
| 4 | **Tuesday Test** | Will someone remember this on a random Tuesday 2 weeks later? What daily-life moment will trigger the memory? If nothing → kill it. | |
| 5 | **TG Filter Test** | Would ONLY the target audience care about this? Or would anyone find it mildly interesting? If it's not TG-filtered → rework the hook. | |
| 6 | **Value Stack Test** | Does the viewer get NEW information/value every 3-5 seconds? Or does the same message repeat? If repetitive → restructure. | |

### Bonus — The 14-Point Concept Checklist (for deep review):

| # | Principle | Quick Check |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **SIMPLE** | One core message only. Remove everything except one sentence — does it work alone? |
| 2 | **UNEXPECTED** | Is there a schema violation? Genre mismatch, scale mismatch, response mismatch? |
| 3 | **CONCRETE** | Specific numbers, names, places? No abstract words like "affordable" or "great." |
| 4 | **CREDIBLE** | Would a skeptic believe this? Real detail, real social proof, testable claim? |
| 5 | **EMOTIONAL** | High-arousal emotion? Pride, guilt, amusement, anxiety, surprise — NOT sadness/calm. |
| 6 | **STORY** | Character + tension + resolution? Could someone RETELL this? |
| 7 | **SELF-PROJECTION** | Can the viewer see THEMSELVES in this? Same age, city, life situation? |
| 8 | **LOSS FRAME** | Does the current state feel like a LOSS? Does the product feel like RESTORATION? |
| 9 | **TG FILTER** | Would ONLY the target audience find this relevant? |
| 10 | **DAILY TRIGGER** | Connected to something the viewer sees EVERY DAY? |
| 11 | **SHARE IMPULSE** | After watching, would they send this to someone specific? Who? |
| 12 | **RETENTION** | New micro-hook every 3-5 seconds? Open loops? Value stacking? |
| 13 | **BRIDGE MOMENT** | Product appears as a SOLUTION to a TENSION? Not just placed — it RESOLVES something. |
| 14 | **RETELL TEST** | Someone can describe this over chai with BCH/e-cycle naturally in the retelling? |

**Scoring:** 10+/14 = ship it. 7-9/14 = rework. Below 7 = kill it.

---
---

# STEP 8: FORMAT THE CONCEPT (Mandatory 3-Section Structure)

Every written concept MUST have these 3 clearly labeled sections:

### Section 1: Pattern Interruption Visual Hook (First 2-3 Seconds)
- What physically happens to stop the scroll
- Must open a **MENTAL LOOP** — "what the hell is happening?" — that only closes after watching the full video
- Score it 0-10. Below 8 = redo.
- Must work for a random person who has NEVER heard of BCH

### Section 2: Hook → Body (Seamless Transition)
- How the hook leads naturally into the story/value
- New value every 3-5 seconds
- ONE clear line: **"PROMOTING: [what we're selling]"**
- Entertainment wrapper around real value

### Section 3: Body → CTA
- How the story naturally leads to the call to action
- Formula: Signature Phrase + Behavioral Trigger + Location + Deadline + DM Keyword

### Example Format:

```
CONCEPT: SB7 — Trade-In Funeral
HOOK SCORE: 9/10

SECTION 1 — PATTERN INTERRUPTION (0-3 sec):
Syed Bhai stands next to a rusty old cycle. A garland hangs on the handlebars.
Incense burns at the base. He's performing the last rites for a cycle.
Viewer thinks: "What the hell is this? A funeral for a bicycle?"

SECTION 2 — BODY (3-20 sec):
PROMOTING: Trade-in offer (exchange old cycle for discount on new e-cycle)
Syed Bhai delivers a mock eulogy for the rusty cycle — lists all the
problems (chain snap, flat tires, rust, squeaky brakes) as "cause of death."
Then: "But there's an afterlife." Reveals a brand new e-cycle behind him.
Value stack: no chain, no flats, charges like a phone, Rs. 999/month EMI.

SECTION 3 — CTA (20-25 sec):
"Electric cycle kaafi nahi — BCH chahiye."
"Next time your cycle chain snaps, don't fix it. Bring it to BCH Jayanagar.
Trade it in before Sunday. DM 'TRADE' for instant quote."
```

---
---

# STEP 9: CHECK AGAINST SHOOTING CONSTRAINTS

Before finalizing any concept, verify it's actually shootable.

### What We CAN Use:

| Resource | Details |
|---|---|
| **Locations** | BCH store interior, store entrance, immediate footpath/street outside. NOTHING ELSE. |
| **Talent** | Zubair + Sami (regular), BCH staff (always), real walk-in customers (spontaneous), kid walk-ins |
| **Camera** | iPhone 15 Pro Max (4K, slow-mo, cinematic mode, action mode), Ray-Ban Meta glasses (hidden POV) |
| **Crew** | Anil (lead videographer) + 1 assistant |
| **Props owned** | Movie clapperboard, white beard/wig, black beard, mustache party pack, alta/boka, dark towel, cricket bat, red marker, laminated price tags, pen, notebook, printer |
| **Store products as props** | E-cycles, pocket bike, helmets, accessories, price tags, brochures, free gift items (~38), trade-in cycles |
| **Editing** | Basic cuts, text overlay, slow-mo, time-lapse, cinematic mode, action mode, sound effects |

### What We CANNOT Guarantee:

- Home setups, kitchens, bedrooms — **NEVER**
- Parks, outdoor locations, external locations — **NO**
- Hospitals, colleges, offices, party venues — **NO**
- Multiple vehicles, large groups of extras — **NO**
- Client's car or client's house — SOMETIMES, not guaranteed

### Props Budget:

Rs. 1000-2000 per item maximum. Simple, everyday objects used in unexpected ways.

**Rule:** If a concept needs something NOT on the resources list, flag it BEFORE writing the full script.

# STEP 10: PRE-SHOOT CHECKLIST (Print This for Every Shoot)

- [ ] WHO is this for? (wrote the specific TG description)
- [ ] WHAT will they FEEL? (named the high-arousal emotion)
- [ ] WHAT will they DO after watching? (named the specific action)
- [ ] ONE SENTENCE test passed?
- [ ] RETELL test passed? (BCH/e-cycle naturally appears in retelling)
- [ ] All 4 hook layers designed? (visual, spoken, text, SFX)
- [ ] Hook score 8+ out of 10?
- [ ] Shot list ready? (every camera angle, every cut, every text overlay planned)
- [ ] Audio decided? (trending BGM for entertainment, original voiceover for conversion)
- [ ] Props ready? (checked against resources list)
- [ ] Location confirmed? (store + street only)
- [ ] "PROMOTING: ___" line is clear?

---
---

# STEP 11: DURING THE SHOOT (Second-by-Second Guide)

| Second | What Must Happen | Viewer's Brain |
|---|---|---|
| **0-1** | VISUAL SHOCK — physical action, dramatic first frame | "What is happening?" |
| **1-3** | CONTEXT CLUE — enough to understand the situation, NOT the outcome | "Oh I see... but why?" |
| **3-5** | ESCALATION — bigger, funnier, more intense | "Oh wow" |
| **5-8** | THE TURN — unexpected twist, mismatch reveals itself | "I didn't expect that" |
| **8-12** | THE PAYOFF — open loop closes, joke lands, emotion peaks | "That was amazing" |
| **12-15** | THE RESIDUE — CTA, final frame that sticks | "I need to show someone" |

For 30-second Reels: double the pattern with a second escalation + second open loop at second 15.

### 3 Acid Tests (After Shooting, Before Editing):

1. **DM Test:** Would someone send this to a specific person with "bro look at this"?
2. **Chai Test:** Would someone describe this to a friend over chai, with BCH/e-cycle in the description?
3. **Tuesday Test:** Will someone remember this on a random Tuesday two weeks later?

If any test fails → reshoot or re-edit.

---

# STEP 12: POST-PRODUCTION SPECS

### Video Specs:

| Spec | Value |
|---|---|
| Resolution | 1080 x 1920 (Full HD, 9:16) |
| Frame Rate | 30 FPS |
| Format | MP4 (H.264 codec) |
| Bitrate | 10-20 Mbps |
| Audio | AAC, 128-256 kbps |
| Max file size | 4 GB |
| Watermarks | **NONE** (no TikTok, no CapCut logos — automatic downrank) |
| Upload | From MOBILE app (better pipeline than desktop) |

### Text Overlays (MANDATORY — 85% Watch on Mute):

- Max 5-7 words per text block
- Bold, clean, sans-serif font — CONSISTENT across all Reels
- Position: CENTER of screen. Avoid top 15% and bottom 40%
- Always overlay: PRICE + CTA + "BCH" or "Bangalore"
- Bold or color ONE key word per overlay (e.g., "**FREE** delivery")

### Caption Structure:

```
[Bold opening — restates the hook]
[2-3 lines of value: use case, pain point, feature]
[Price/offer with specific numbers]
[CTA — one specific action]
.
.
.
[3-5 hashtags]
```

- PRIMARY keyword in the FIRST LINE (before "...more")
- Keywords: "e-cycle," "electric cycle," "kids cycle," "Bangalore," "BCH"

### Hashtags (Max 5 per post):

| Type | How Many | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Niche-specific | 2-3 | #ecycle #electriccycleindia #kidscycle |
| Location | 1 | #bangalorecycling #bangalorestore |
| Trending (only if relevant) | 0-1 | #reelsviral |

### Audio Selection:

| Content Type | Audio Strategy |
|---|---|
| Mass Series | Actual movie BGMs (trending in South India) |
| Pocket Bike Series | Original audio (reactions, dialogue) + trending background |
| Conversion Reels | Original voiceover (founder/staff) — gets algorithmic preference |
| Entertainment | Audio that's STARTING to trend (catch early, not after saturation) |

### Cover Image / Thumbnail:

- 1080 x 1920 (9:16), BUT grid crops to center 1080 x 1080
- Keep ALL critical text/faces within center square
- Bold headline (3-5 words) telling viewers what the Reel is about
- Consistent brand colors across all covers

---
---

# STEP 13: POSTING PROTOCOL

### Posting Time:

| Day | Best Times (IST) | Content Type |
|---|---|---|
| Sunday | 11 AM, 7 PM | **Conversion** — parents browsing with kids |
| Monday | 9 AM, 12 PM, 7 PM | Stories only |
| Tuesday | 9 AM, 11 AM, 7 PM | Entertainment Reel |
| Wednesday | 9 AM, 11 AM, 1 PM | **Conversion** — best engagement day |
| Thursday | 10 AM, 12 PM, 8 PM | Stories only |
| Friday | 11 AM, 2 PM, 4 PM | Entertainment Reel — weekend anticipation |
| Saturday | 10 AM, 8 PM | **Conversion** — "Visit BCH today" |

**Always override with YOUR Instagram Insights** for your specific audience's active hours.

### The CRITICAL First 30 Minutes After Posting:

| Minute | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **0-1** | Post the Reel | — |
| **1-2** | Share to Instagram Story with curiosity sticker ("Watch till the end" / "Wait for the price") | Story viewers who tap through = extra views + engagement |
| **2-5** | Send via DM to 5-10 people who would GENUINELY care about this content | Seeds DM shares — tells algorithm the content is share-worthy. DM shares are 3-5x more valuable than likes |
| **5-30** | Stay on Instagram. Reply to EVERY comment within SECONDS | Quick replies boost engagement velocity. Each reply = doubles comment count. Fast replies encourage MORE comments |
| **5-30** | Like and respond to DMs about the Reel | DM conversations signal engagement quality |
| **15-30** | Share Reel link to WhatsApp Status / BCH customer WhatsApp groups | External traffic. WhatsApp-to-Instagram clicks = high-intent views |

### What NOT to Do in First 30 Minutes:

- **Do NOT edit the caption** — editing resets algorithmic signals
- **Do NOT delete and repost** — give it at least 24-48 hours
- **Do NOT cross-post to Facebook simultaneously** — prevents boosting
- **Do NOT leave the app** — your active engagement directly affects Wave 1
- **Do NOT post another Reel** — wait at least 4-6 hours between Reels

### 24-48 Hour Follow-Up:

| Timeframe | Action |
|---|---|
| 2-4 hours | Post follow-up Story mentioning the Reel |
| 6-12 hours | If performing well, share to Stories AGAIN with a new angle |
| 24 hours | Check Insights: watch time, shares, saves, connected vs unconnected reach |
| 48 hours | If still getting engagement, share one more time in Stories |
| 1 week | Pin to grid if it's a top performer |

### Posting Frequency:

| Content Type | Frequency |
|---|---|
| Reels | 3-5 per week, spaced 6+ hours apart |
| Stories | Daily, 2-4 per day every 2-3 hours during active hours |
| Feed posts (carousels) | 1-2 per week for detailed product info |

**Consistency > Volume. Steady 4/week > erratic 7 then 1.**

---
---

# STEP 14: TRACKING & LEARNING

### Metrics That Actually Matter (Algorithm Signal Hierarchy):

| Signal | Weight | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **DM Shares/Sends** | HEAVIEST | "Worth recommending" — drives new audience reach |
| **Saves** | HEAVY | "I'll come back" — drives long-tail distribution |
| **Comments** | HEAVY | "This sparked a reaction" — moderate expansion |
| **Watch Time / 3-sec hold** | FOUNDATIONAL | Decides if Instagram keeps showing it AT ALL |
| **Likes** | LIGHTER | "This was decent" — minor boost |

**10 DM shares > 100 likes for reaching new audiences.**

### Benchmarks:

| Metric | Good | Great | Viral |
|---|---|---|---|
| Save rate (saves / reach) | 1-2% | 3-5% | 5%+ |
| Share rate (sends / reach) | 0.5-1% | 1-3% | 3%+ |
| 3-second hold rate | 40%+ | 60%+ | 75%+ |

### Reading the Data:

- **Lots of likes but few saves/shares** → Content is entertaining but not VALUABLE or RELATABLE enough
- **Lots of saves but few shares** → Content is useful but not EMOTIONAL or FUNNY enough to forward

### Weekly Review (Every Sunday Night):

- [ ] Which Reel got the most SHARES this week? Why?
- [ ] Which Reel got the most SAVES this week? Why?
- [ ] Which Reel had the highest 3-second hold rate? Why?
- [ ] Which Reel drove the most DMs or store visits? Why?
- [ ] What patterns are emerging? (TG, hook type, length, audio)

# LANGUAGE RULES (The Curse of Knowledge)

Before publishing, ask: **"Would a mother in Yelahanka who has never thought about e-cycles until today understand and FEEL this in 3 seconds?"**

| NEVER Say | ALWAYS Say Instead |
|---|---|
| "48V 13Ah lithium-ion battery" | "Charges overnight like your phone, lasts all weekend" |
| "350W brushless motor" | "Your kid can ride it without pedaling when they're tired" |
| "Pedal assist" | "It helps you pedal — like a push from behind" |
| "Great mileage" | "Rs. 7 for 100 km" |
| "Affordable EMI" | "Rs. 999/month — less than Netflix" |
| "Many customers" | "12 people drove from Bellari at 10 PM" |
| "Kids love it" | "My kid hasn't touched his phone in 14 days" |

# LOCAL DENSITY STRATEGY

Your biggest growth lever isn't viral Reels — it's building a high concentration of REAL, NEARBY followers.

- **Geotag** "Bharath Cycle Hub, Bangalore" on EVERY post and Story
- Feature recognizable Bangalore landmarks/streets near BCH at least 1x/week
- Use Kannada phrases or local slang in some Reels
- Respond to every local commenter
- Balance: 70% local (Bangalore-targeted) + 30% broad (pan-India entertainment)

---

# CORE PHILOSOPHY — REMEMBER THESE

1. **Instagram = entertainment platform.** Not education, not direct selling. Entertain on IG → funnel to store/DMs/WhatsApp for actual selling.
2. **Strong hook + wrong audience = wasted content.** (The Tata Ace Lesson)
3. **The concept IS the hook.** If describing it in one sentence doesn't make someone laugh, it's not a concept.
4. **Genre mismatch = the comedy formula.** Everyday situation + absurd dramatic genre = comedy. The more serious the genre (crime, legal, medical, military), the funnier it is applied to mundane family life.
5. **Shares > Comments > Just views.** Design for sharing first.
6. **Content must feel ORGANIC, not ad-like.** Shot and posted. No "produced ad" energy.

8. **Simple + clever > complex + impressive.** The best concepts use everyday objects in unexpected ways.
9. **Don't celebrate — make it look suspicious.** When filming real customer moments, crime-thriller energy >>> sentimental/celebratory energy.
10. **The parent guilt trigger:** Today's parents didn't get fancy cycles as kids. They want to change that for their children. This is a core conversion driver.
