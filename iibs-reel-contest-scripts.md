## PRODUCTION NOTES FOR CONTESTANTS

**What you NEED:**
- 6-7 team members (everyone gets a speaking role)
- Campus location (corridor, classroom, open ground)
- Simple props: paper, pens, sunglasses, blazers, makeshift gavel (book), placards (chart paper + marker)
- One phone to shoot (9:16 vertical, 60fps if possible)
- Good lighting (shoot outdoors or near windows)

**What makes you WIN:**
- The FIRST 3 seconds decide everything. Nail the visual hook.
- Physical comedy > dialogue. SHOW, don't just TELL.
- Energy matters more than production quality. Be LOUD, be FAST, be COMMITTED to the bit.
- BCH name + "Jayanagar" must appear at least 2 times visually and once spoken.
- The funnier the concept, the more the judges AND viewers share it.

**What to AVOID:**
- Starting with "Like, subscribe, follow" — instant death
- Standing and talking to camera — every store does this
- Generic text like "BIG OFFER" — be specific with numbers
- Low energy — if you're not having fun, the viewer won't either
