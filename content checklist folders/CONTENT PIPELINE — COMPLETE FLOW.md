- NO → The Reel's reach will suffer. Don't skip the engagement window.

---

## STAGE 7: TRACK & LEARN → Feeds back into Stage 1

**Who does it:** Ops Manager

**Process:**
1. Track at 1h, 6h, 24h, 48h: Views, Likes, Comments, Saves, Sends, 3-sec hold rate, Watch time, Reach vs followers
2. Classify the Reel:
   - **Winner** (high sends + saves + 3x+ reach) → Document what worked. REPLICATE this format.
   - **Average** (normal engagement) → Analyze what could be improved.
   - **Weak** (low retention/sends) → Analyze what went wrong, especially the hook.
3. Update performance Google Sheet
4. Share learnings with the team (what worked, what didn't)
5. Feed insights back into Stage 1 for the next idea

**The loop never stops. Every Reel teaches you what to do next.**

---

## THE GOLDEN RULES (Across All Stages)

1. **If the hook is weak → everything fails.** Kill weak hooks at every stage.
2. **Never shoot average ideas.** Reject at Stage 1, not Stage 5.
3. **DM shares are the #1 algorithm signal.** Ask "would someone send this to a friend?" at every stage.
4. **Instagram is a search engine now.** Keywords must appear in: spoken audio, on-screen text, caption, alt text, cover.
5. **The first 30 minutes after posting decide everything.** Never post and walk away.
6. **Consistency beats volume.** 3-5 quality posts/week > 7 rushed posts/week.
7. **B-roll sells the product, not A-roll.** Always overshoot B-roll (15+ clips minimum).
8. **Every stage has a gate.** If it doesn't pass → go back. Don't push bad content forward.

## ESCALATION RULES

| Situation | Escalate To |
|---|---|
| Idea doesn't hit 8/10 after 3 attempts | Syed — rethink the content direction |
| Hook is weak and team can't fix it | Syed — different angle needed |
| No relevant B-roll exists | Varun → Syed → then proceed |
| Music selection isn't strong enough | Syed for approval before rendering |
| Client won't deliver the right performance | Offer goodies, if still weak → Syed decides |
| Reel classified as "Weak" 3x in a row | Team review with Syed — systemic issue |
