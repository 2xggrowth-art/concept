# INSTAGRAM POSTING PROCESS CHECKLIST (Updated Feb 2026)

---

## PHASE 1: PRE-POST PREPARATION (Before You Touch Instagram)

### Asset Readiness
- [ ] Final video approved
- [ ] Video is under 45 seconds (sweet spot for IG Reels)
- [ ] Upload resolution is 1080x1920 pixels minimum
- [ ] No TikTok or competitor watermarks (Instagram suppresses these — confirmed)
- [ ] Audio playing correctly
- [ ] Subtitles visible from first frame
- [ ] No glitches, compression issues, or blurry frames
- [ ] Version without music created (for YouTube Shorts cross-post)

### Thumbnail / Cover Frame
- [ ] Custom thumbnail designed separately (do NOT just pick a random frame)
- [ ] Bold, readable headline text on cover
- [ ] All critical elements sit within the center square zone (IG crops to 1:1 on grid)
- [ ] Human face with expression included (outperforms text-only covers)
- [ ] Cover frame readable on small screens
- [ ] Text not cut off by IG UI elements
- [ ] Consistent brand template matching your other covers
- [ ] Second-hand logo on top right corner (for second-hand content)

### Instagram SEO Optimization (NEW — Critical for 2026)
- [ ] Primary keyword placed in first 2 sentences of caption
- [ ] Secondary keywords woven naturally throughout caption
- [ ] Target keywords spoken OUT LOUD in the Reel (IG transcribes and indexes audio)
- [ ] On-screen text contains keyword phrases (IG indexes text overlays — Google crawls this too)
- [ ] Custom alt text written with target keywords (Settings > Advanced > Alt Text — never leave blank)
- [ ] Cover text includes a searchable, keyword-rich title

---

## PHASE 2: CAPTION, HASHTAGS & TAGS

### Caption Structure (3-4 Sections)
- [ ] **First 125 characters (visible preview):** Scroll-stopping hook that compels "See More" tap. Primary keyword goes here.
- [ ] **Paragraph 1:** What is happening in the reel
- [ ] **Paragraph 2:** Product details, features, specifications, price
- [ ] **Paragraph 3:** CTA (see CTA section below)
- [ ] **Last line:** Hashtags
- [ ] Short paragraphs only (1-2 lines max)
- [ ] No spelling or grammar errors
- [ ] Line breaks used for scannability (no walls of text)

### Hashtag Strategy (UPDATED — Major 2026 Change)
- [ ] Maximum 5 hashtags only (Instagram now enforces a 5-hashtag limit)
- [ ] All 5 hashtags are niche-relevant (no broad/spammy tags)
- [ ] Mix of:
  - Niche hashtags (e.g., #secondhandbikes)
  - Local hashtags (e.g., #bangalorecycling)
  - Product-specific keywords (e.g., #mountainbike)
- [ ] Keywords in caption matter MORE than hashtags now — treat caption as your SEO tool
- [ ] No banned or broken hashtags (check before using)

### Tagging
- [ ] Brand account tagged
- [ ] Product / model tagged (if applicable)
- [ ] Location tagged (store / city)
- [ ] Collaborator or creator tagged using official Collab feature (3.4x higher engagement vs solo posts)

---

## PHASE 3: CTA STRATEGY (UPDATED — Optimized for Saves + Shares)

### CTA Requirements
- [ ] CTA included in 3 places simultaneously:
  1. On-screen text at the end of the Reel (visual CTA)
  2. Voiceover in the final 2-3 seconds (audio CTA)
  3. Caption as the final line before hashtags (written CTA)

### Save-Driving CTAs (Use one per post)
- "Save this for your next [specific situation]"
- "Bookmark this — you'll need it when [specific moment]"
- "Save this checklist for later"

### Share-Driving CTAs (Use one per post — THIS IS THE #1 ALGORITHM SIGNAL)
- "Send this to someone who [specific identity/situation]"
- "Your [friend/riding buddy] needs to see this"
- "Tag someone who's been looking for this"

### Action-Driving CTAs
- "Comment [keyword] and we'll DM you details"
- "Visit the store — link in bio"
- "Watch the full reel"

---

## PHASE 4: PRE-POSTING ROUTINE (NEW — 15 Minutes Before Posting)

- [ ] Spend 10-15 minutes engaging with other accounts' content in your niche (like, comment, watch reels)
- [ ] This signals activity to the algorithm and primes your account for better initial distribution
- [ ] Confirm posting time is during peak hours:
  - **Best days:** Wednesday and Thursday
  - **Best times:** 11AM-2PM or after 6PM
  - **Always check:** Your own Instagram Insights for your audience's active times (overrides general benchmarks)
- [ ] Stable internet connection confirmed

---

## PHASE 5: UPLOAD CHECKLIST

- [ ] Upload as Reel (not post)
- [ ] Select reel with viral/trending audio (check IG's "Trending" indicator in audio library)
- [ ] Double-check video sync after upload
- [ ] Audio playing correctly
- [ ] Subtitles visible and not overlapping IG UI
- [ ] Tags working properly
- [ ] Cover frame displays correctly on grid preview

---

## PHASE 6: IMMEDIATELY AFTER POSTING (First 5 Minutes)

### Pin Comments Strategy (NEW — Pin Up to 3 Comments)
- [ ] Pin Comment #1: Open-ended question that sparks discussion
  - Example: "Which one would you pick — the blue or the black?"
  - Example: "Does this work for your riding style? Tell me below"
- [ ] Pin Comment #2: CTA comment
  - Example: "Save this for your next bike hunt"
  - Example: "Send this to your riding buddy"
- [ ] Pin Comment #3: Social proof (positive customer comment, once available)

### Story Support
- [ ] Share Reel to Story immediately with interactive sticker (poll / question / slider)
  - Example poll: "Would you ride this? YES / NO"
  - Example question: "What bike are you riding right now?"
- [ ] Post 1-2 additional Stories supporting the Reel throughout the day

### Broadcast Channel (NEW — Critical for 2026)
- [ ] Share the Reel to your Broadcast Channel with a discussion prompt
  - Example: "Just dropped this — what do you think about the price?"
- [ ] Use a poll in the channel to drive interaction
- [ ] Attach Reminder for upcoming content drops (if applicable)

### DM Shares Strategy (NEW — #1 Algorithm Signal)
- [ ] DM the Reel to 5-10 people who would genuinely find it valuable
- [ ] These must be real, relevant sends — not mass-blasting
- [ ] DM shares are 3-5x more valuable than likes for reaching new audiences

### Distribution
- [ ] Share reel to:
  - Story (with interactive sticker)
  - Broadcast Channel
  - Relevant close friends list (if used)
  - WhatsApp Status / groups (if applicable)

---

## PHASE 7: FIRST 30 MINUTES — ENGAGEMENT WINDOW (CRITICAL)

### Comment Response Rules (UPDATED)
- [ ] **Be online for the full 30 minutes after posting**
- [ ] Reply to every comment within **3 minutes** for maximum algorithmic boost
- [ ] Every reply must be **4+ words** (emoji-only and "thanks" replies carry ZERO weight in 2026)
- [ ] Reply with a **follow-up question** to create threaded conversations
  - Someone says "Love this!" → Reply: "Thank you! Which feature caught your eye the most?"
  - Someone says "How much?" → Reply: "Great question! DM us for the best price — are you looking for yourself or a gift?"
- [ ] Like early comments to boost engagement signals
- [ ] Instagram now tracks **conversation depth** — long replies and reply chains = "high social relevance" = Explore push

---

## PHASE 8: CROSS-POSTING (NEW — Within 48 Hours)

- [ ] Export clean, watermark-free version for each platform
- [ ] Tailor first 1-3 seconds for each platform's audience:
  - **TikTok:** Raw, authentic, trend-driven energy
  - **YouTube Shorts:** Educational, searchable, evergreen angle
  - **Facebook Reels:** Broader demographic, less polish needed
- [ ] Stagger posting times across platforms (don't post everywhere simultaneously)
- [ ] Post order: Instagram Reels → TikTok → YouTube Shorts → Facebook Reels

---

## PHASE 9: PERFORMANCE TRACKING (UPDATED)

### Save the reel link and track:

| Metric | 1h | 6h | 24h | 48h |
|--------|----|----|-----|-----|
| Views | | | | |
| Likes | | | | |
| Comments | | | | |
| Saves | | | | |
| **Sends (DM Shares)** | | | | |
| **3-Second Hold Rate** | | | | |
| **Watch Time / Retention %** | | | | |
| **Reach vs Follower Count** | | | | |
| Replays / Rewatches | | | | |

### Key Benchmarks to Know
- **3-second hold rate above 60%** = 5-10x more reach than below 40%
- **Reach = 3x your follower count** = strong performer
- **Reach = 10x+ your follower count** = viral territory
- **Engagement rate above 2%** = outperforming platform average
- **High sends + high saves** = content format to replicate immediately

### Classify the Reel
- **Winner** — High sends + saves + reach 3x+ followers → REPLICATE this format
- **Average** — Normal engagement, nothing exceptional
- **Weak** — Low retention, low sends → analyze what went wrong with the hook

---

## PHASE 10: WEEKLY CONTENT RHYTHM (NEW)

### Optimal Posting Schedule
- **3-4 Reels per week** (reach and discovery)
- **2-3 Carousels per week** (highest engagement and saves — add audio to push into Reels tab)
- **1-2 Static posts per week** (brand and community)
- **Near-daily Stories** with interactive stickers (retention and relationship)

### Consistency Rules
- Post on a regular rhythm your audience can rely on
- Erratic posting (7 reels one week, silence the next) is penalized by the algorithm
- **Quality > quantity** — a 10-second Reel with 80% retention beats a 60-second Reel with 30% retention every time

## QUICK REFERENCE: 2026 ALGORITHM SIGNAL HIERARCHY

| Rank | Signal | Weight | What Drives It |
|------|--------|--------|---------------|
| #1 | **Watch Time** | Highest | Strong hook, tight editing, no dead moments |
| #2 | **DM Shares (Sends)** | 3-5x > likes | Relatable content people want to forward to friends |
| #3 | **Saves** | ~3x > likes | Evergreen, reference-worthy content (tutorials, lists) |
| #4 | **Likes per Reach** | Baseline | General content quality |
| #5 | **Comments (Depth)** | Growing | Open-ended questions, pinned prompts, threaded replies |
| #6 | **Replays** | Hidden multiplier | Loop-worthy short content, surprise endings |

## THINGS THAT WILL KILL YOUR REACH (Avoid These)

- [ ] Using more than 5 hashtags (Instagram blocks publishing)
- [ ] Posting with TikTok or competitor watermarks (confirmed suppression)
- [ ] Reposting content without transformation (10+ reposts in 30 days = excluded from recommendations)
- [ ] Bot-like behavior (40+ comments in 1 hour, mass DMs, auto-liking tools)
- [ ] Replying to comments with just emojis or "thanks" (zero algorithmic weight)
- [ ] Uploading below 1080x1920 resolution (penalized for low quality)
- [ ] Inconsistent posting schedule (posting 7 reels one week, disappearing the next)
- [ ] Using banned or broken hashtags (even once can make your post invisible to non-followers)
- [ ] Ignoring comments entirely (algorithm notices low creator-to-audience interaction)
- [ ] Posting only promotional content (IG wants entertainment and education, not ads)
