# HOW TO MAKE A SHOT LIST (Updated Feb 2026)

**1 RULE: If this shot list is not ready → shoot does NOT start.**

Every shot list must follow this structure:

---

## TEMPLATE HEADER

```
Video Title: ________________________
Reference Reel Link: ________________________
Audio / Music Reference: ________________________
Target Keyword: ________________________
Content Format: [ ] Talking Head  [ ] B-roll + Text  [ ] POV  [ ] Tutorial  [ ] Before/After
Total Target Duration: _____ seconds
```

---

## 1. HOOK SHOTS (MANDATORY)

Multiple versions — the editor needs options:

- [ ] Close-up (face — expressive, high energy)
- [ ] Mid-shot
- [ ] High-energy version
- [ ] Calm version
- [ ] Slow version
- [ ] Reference-style version (match the exact angle/delivery of the viral reel)

**Minimum 5-7 takes. If the hook is weak, the entire video fails.**

---

## 2. MAIN CONTENT SHOTS (A-Roll)

Break your script into 3-5 bullet points. List 1 shot per point.

| # | Script Bullet Point | Shot Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ________________________ | __________ | __________ |
| 2 | ________________________ | __________ | __________ |
| 3 | ________________________ | __________ | __________ |
| 4 | ________________________ | __________ | __________ |
| 5 | ________________________ | __________ | __________ |

- This keeps the main talking part clean and structured
- Team doesn't forget key lines
- **Ensure target keywords are spoken clearly in these takes** (Instagram indexes speech for SEO)

---

## 3. B-ROLL SHOTS (Mandatory for Virality)

### Standard B-Roll Pack (Always Include):
- [ ] Wide shot of the product
- [ ] Close-up of key details (tyres, gears, frame)
- [ ] Gear shifting close-up
- [ ] Suspension bounce close-up
- [ ] Logo / branding close-up
- [ ] Riding shot (10 sec, stable)
- [ ] Hands touching handlebar / product
- [ ] Store environment
- [ ] Customer browsing
- [ ] Signature "Syed bicycle shot"
- [ ] Any unique detail shown in the reference reel

### Additional B-Roll (NEW):
- [ ] **Lifestyle / emotion:** Customer reaction, rider smile, satisfaction moment
- [ ] **POV shots:** First-person riding, walking through store, unboxing
- [ ] **Slow-motion:** Gear shifting, wheel spin, suspension (for pacing variation)
- [ ] **Text-safe shots:** 2-3 clips with clean/minimal background for text overlay
- [ ] **Before/after:** If applicable

### B-Roll Rules:
- All B-roll in **9:16 vertical**
- **Minimum 10-15 clips** per shoot
- Store clean and tidy, proper lighting, different angles
- Short and crisp: 2-5 seconds each

---

## 4. THUMBNAIL SHOTS (NEW)

Dedicated shots for custom cover design — NOT random screenshots:

- [ ] Thumbnail shot 1: Face (expressive) + product visible + clean background
- [ ] Thumbnail shot 2: Different angle / expression
- [ ] Thumbnail shot 3: Product hero shot with space for text overlay
- [ ] Leave space in frame for bold headline text (rule of thirds)

---

## 5. CTA SHOTS

At least 2-3 versions — editors need variations:

- [ ] CTA 1: ________________________ (e.g., "DM us for details")
- [ ] CTA 2: ________________________ (e.g., "Visit our store in [city]")
- [ ] CTA 3: ________________________ (e.g., "Send this to your riding buddy")
- [ ] Each CTA shot from **2-3 different angles and energy levels**

---

## 6. ON-SCREEN TEXT PLANNING (NEW)

Note which shots will have text overlays so the shooter leaves visual space:

| Shot | Text Overlay Planned | Leave Space? |
|---|---|---|
| Hook | "________________________" | Yes — center/top |
| Point 2 B-roll | "________________________" | Yes — lower third |
| CTA | "________________________" | Yes — center |

---

## 7. REFERENCE ALIGNMENT (Critical — 99% Skip This)

This is the step that ensures your video actually "feels" like the viral one:

- [ ] Audio reference noted: ________________________
- [ ] Editing speed noted: Fast / Medium / Slow
- [ ] Camera angles matched to reference
- [ ] Transitions required: ________________________
- [ ] Color tone needed: ________________________
- [ ] Music style: ________________________
- [ ] Emotional appeal: ________________________
- [ ] Pacing pattern: ________________________ (e.g., fast-fast-slow-fast)

---

## 8. SHOT ORDER (Final Layout)

Your final shot list should follow this order on set:

```
1. Hook Shots (5-7 takes, multiple angles)
        ↓
2. Main Shots / A-Roll (2-3 takes per bullet point)
        ↓
3. B-Roll Shots (10-15 minimum, all types)
        ↓
4. Thumbnail Shots (2-3 dedicated frames)
        ↓
5. CTA Shots (2-3 versions, multiple angles)
        ↓
6. Voiceover (if recording on location)
```
