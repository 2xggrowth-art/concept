# OPS MANAGER PLAYBOOK — DAILY & WEEKLY ROUTINES

**You are the single point of accountability for the entire content pipeline. Nothing ships without your sign-off. Nothing falls through the cracks on your watch.**

---

## YOUR ROLE IN ONE LINE

You own the pipeline from idea to performance tracking. You don't do everything yourself — you ensure everything gets done, on time, at quality, by the right person.

---

## DAILY ROUTINE

### MORNING BLOCK (First 1-2 Hours)

**1. Pipeline Status Check (15 min)**
- [ ] Open the Google Sheet and check where every piece of content currently sits:
  - What's in Idea stage?
  - What's in Script stage?
  - What's scheduled for shoot today?
  - What's with the editor?
  - What's ready to post?
  - What was posted yesterday (needs tracking)?
- [ ] Flag any bottleneck — if something is stuck, unblock it immediately
- [ ] Confirm today's posting time and which Reel is going live

**2. Viral Scouting (30 min — NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- [ ] Browse competitor pages, niche hashtags, Explore page, Reels tab
- [ ] Look for reels that are **2X-10X the normal views** of that page
- [ ] Save potential references to a running list
- [ ] For each strong reference: note the hook, emotion, format, and why it went viral
- [ ] Run 2-3 through the Idea Checklist scoring — anything 8/10+ gets queued

**3. Content Review Queue (30 min)**
- [ ] Review any scripts waiting for approval (score against Script Checklist)
- [ ] Review any edits waiting for approval (run the Shareability Test)
- [ ] Give feedback immediately — never let a review sit for more than 24 hours
- [ ] If something needs Syed's input → escalate with your recommendation, not just the question

### MIDDAY BLOCK

**4. Shoot Supervision (If shoot is happening today)**
- [ ] Confirm shot list is complete and printed before shoot starts
- [ ] Be on-set or on-call for the entire shoot
- [ ] Verify hook performance live (watch takes, push for better if needed)
- [ ] Ensure B-roll minimum (15+ clips) is hit before anyone leaves
- [ ] Run the Quality Verification checklist before leaving location
- [ ] Ensure files are organized and uploaded to Google Drive by EOD

**5. Editor Check-In (If no shoot today)**
- [ ] Check in with editor on current edit progress
- [ ] Confirm they have: all footage, reference reel, script with on-screen text notes, target keyword
- [ ] Preview rough cut if available — catch issues early (don't wait for final render)

### AFTERNOON / EVENING BLOCK

**6. Post the Reel (At scheduled peak time)**
Follow all 10 phases of the [INSTAGRAM POSTING CHECKLIST — UPDATED 2026.md](INSTAGRAM%20POSTING%20CHECKLIST%20%E2%80%94%20UPDATED%202026.md):
- [ ] Pre-post checks done (asset, thumbnail, caption, SEO, tags)
- [ ] Reel uploaded at peak time
- [ ] Immediately: pin 3 comments, share to Story + Broadcast Channel, DM to 5-10 people
- [ ] **BE ONLINE FOR 30 MINUTES.** Reply to every comment within 3 minutes. 4+ words. Follow-up questions.
- [ ] Post 1-2 supporting Stories with interactive stickers

**7. Performance Check on Yesterday's Reel (10 min)**
- [ ] Check 24h metrics: Views, Likes, Comments, Saves, Sends, 3-sec hold rate, Reach
- [ ] Update Google Sheet
- [ ] Classify: Winner / Average / Weak
- [ ] If Winner → note what worked, plan to replicate the format
- [ ] If Weak → analyze what went wrong (hook? pacing? audio? timing?) and document for team learning

**8. Cross-Posting (If not done yet)**
- [ ] Post watermark-free versions to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Facebook Reels
- [ ] Stagger timing — don't post everywhere at once

### END OF DAY

**9. EOD Wrap-Up (15 min)**
- [ ] Google Sheet updated with all today's activities
- [ ] Notion updated with any new reference reels
- [ ] Tomorrow's plan is clear:
  - What content is posting tomorrow?
  - Is the asset ready?
  - Any shoots or reviews scheduled?
- [ ] Any escalations sent to Syed before EOD (don't hold overnight)

## WEEKLY ROUTINE

### MONDAY — PLANNING DAY

- [ ] **Week-at-a-glance:** Map out which content posts on which day this week
- [ ] Confirm you have **3-5 pieces of content** ready or in pipeline for the week
- [ ] Ideal weekly mix:
  - 3-4 Reels
  - 2-3 Carousels (if applicable)
  - 1-2 Static posts (if applicable)
  - Stories every day
- [ ] Review last week's performance data:
  - How many Winners vs Average vs Weak?
  - What formats/hooks/emotions performed best?
  - What time slots worked best?
- [ ] Share weekly performance summary with Syed
- [ ] Set goals for this week (e.g., "2 Winner Reels," "test a new format," "improve 3-sec hold rate")

### WEDNESDAY — MID-WEEK CHECK

- [ ] Is the week on track? Are we hitting 3-5 posts?
- [ ] Any bottleneck in the pipeline? (stalled script, delayed edit, no approved idea)
- [ ] If behind → prioritize and unblock. Pull resources if needed.
- [ ] Start scouting ideas for next week (don't wait until Monday)

### FRIDAY — WEEK CLOSE

- [ ] All performance data from this week entered into Google Sheet
- [ ] Classify all Reels from the week: Winner / Average / Weak
- [ ] Document top learnings:
  - Best performing hook this week
  - Best performing format this week
  - Best performing time slot
  - Any mistakes to avoid
- [ ] Prep Monday's content (should be fully ready — not scrambled Monday morning)
- [ ] Refill the idea queue (at least 3-5 scored ideas ready for next week)

## YOUR NON-NEGOTIABLES (Do These Every Day No Matter What)

1. **30 minutes of viral scouting** — the pipeline dies without fresh ideas
2. **Post at peak time** — never miss the scheduled posting time
3. **30 minutes of post-upload engagement** — this window decides everything
4. **Update the Google Sheet by EOD** — if it's not tracked, it didn't happen
5. **Never push bad content forward** — reject at the gate, don't hope it works out

## RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR

| Red Flag | What It Means | Action |
|---|---|---|
| No new ideas scored 8/10+ in 3 days | Scouting is weak or standards are too rigid | Expand reference sources, check different niches/pages |
| Editor waiting for footage > 24 hours | Shoot workflow bottleneck | Speed up organize/upload process |
| 3 "Weak" Reels in a row | Systemic issue — hook, format, or targeting problem | Escalate to Syed for team review |
| Comment replies happening > 1 hour after posting | Engagement window missed | Block your calendar around posting time |
| B-roll running out during edits | Not enough shot during shoot | Enforce 15-clip minimum religiously |
| Posting schedule is inconsistent | Algorithm penalizes erratic posting | Prep content 2 days in advance minimum |
| Script rejected 3x for same issue | Scriptwriter needs training on that specific area | One-on-one coaching session |
| Reel reach dropping week over week | Content or algorithm shift | Analyze what changed — hooks, format, timing, audio |
