## COMMON MISTAKES NEW HIRES MAKE (Avoid These)

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | What to Do Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Posting without checking the caption for keyword SEO | Loses search discovery — 50%+ of new followers come from search | Run every caption through the SEO checklist before posting |
| Leaving the app after posting | First 30 minutes decide the Reel's fate | Block your calendar — be online for 30 min, no exceptions |
| Replying to comments with "Thank you!" or emojis | Zero algorithmic weight in 2026 | 4+ word replies with follow-up questions |
| Using 15+ hashtags | Instagram now limits to 5, old habits die hard | Max 5 niche-relevant hashtags, keywords in caption instead |
| Not tracking "Sends" (DM shares) | Missing the #1 algorithm signal | Add Sends column to your tracking sheet |
| Pushing a weak hook through the pipeline | Hook weakness compounds — weak hook = bad script = bad shoot = bad edit = dead Reel | Kill it at Stage 1. Reject early, reject often. |
| Not watching the reference reel enough times | Edits and shoots miss the viral "feel" | Watch 3 times minimum, note every detail |
| Forgetting alt text | Missed SEO opportunity on every single post | The scriptwriter drafts it, you add it at posting |
| Scrambling for content on posting day | Rushed content = average content = wasted reach | Prep 2 days in advance minimum |
| Not documenting what worked | You repeat mistakes and forget wins | Update the Google Sheet and share weekly learnings |
| Shooting in landscape | All Reels are 9:16 vertical — landscape = cropped = amateur look | Verify phone/camera is vertical before every shoot |
| Skipping the shareability test on edits | Content goes live without the "DM this" factor | Run the 3-question test on every edit, no exceptions |

## REMEMBER

You have experience. The checklists exist so you don't rely on memory. Even experts forget steps when they're busy. The checklist is not a sign of distrust — it's a tool that ensures zero mistakes when the pressure is on.

**Follow the pipeline. Hit the gates. Track everything. The system works when you work the system.**
