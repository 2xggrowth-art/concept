# SHOOT CHECKLIST (Updated Feb 2026)

**Rule: Shoot must score 7/10 or higher. Never leave the location without checking footage.**

---

## PHASE 1: PRE-SHOOT SETUP

### Equipment Check
- [ ] Camera/phone set to **1080x1920 (9:16 vertical)** — never shoot landscape for Reels
- [ ] Frame rate: 30fps minimum (60fps for slow-motion B-roll)
- [ ] **Audio setup:** Lapel mic or wireless mic connected and tested
- [ ] Do a **5-second audio test** — play back and listen for clarity, background noise, echo
- [ ] Audio levels checked — voice must be clear and dominant over background
- [ ] **Lighting check:**
  - Natural light preferred (face the light source, don't backlight the subject)
  - Ring light or softbox if indoors
  - No harsh shadows on face
  - Store lights on and environment well-lit
- [ ] Storage space confirmed — enough for 50+ clips
- [ ] Lens clean

### Reference Preparation
- [ ] Viral reference reel watched **2-3 times** by everyone on set
- [ ] Key angles from reference identified and noted
- [ ] Key emotions from reference identified and noted
- [ ] Shot list printed or on-screen and visible to everyone
- [ ] **If shot list is not ready → shoot does NOT start**

### Talent Preparation
- [ ] For client content: client prepped for at least **5-6 takes**
- [ ] Emotion/performance requirement explained clearly
- [ ] Offer additional goodies if the shoot is done perfectly per requirement
- [ ] Talent has reviewed the script bullet points
- [ ] Tone and energy level communicated (fast / calm / funny / emotional)

---

## PHASE 2: HOOK SHOOTING (Most Critical)

- [ ] Strong hook in the beginning — within **3-5 seconds** we must communicate what the video is about
- [ ] **Minimum 5-7 takes** for the hook
- [ ] Each take at a different angle / energy level / delivery style
- [ ] Every angle has a **different emotional impact** on the viewer — capture variety
- [ ] Watch reference reel between takes to match angles and emotions
- [ ] **A weak delivery kills even the strongest hook** → re-shoot until it is a high-performance take
- [ ] Hook takes include variation:
  - Close-up (face)
  - Mid-shot
  - High-energy version
  - Calm version
  - Reference-style version

---

## PHASE 3: A-ROLL SHOOTING (Main Content)

- [ ] Follow the script's 3-5 bullet points
- [ ] Each point shot **2-3 times** for editor options
- [ ] While shooting, **always shoot what is said** — visual must match verbal for B-roll engagement
- [ ] Talent delivers naturally — no robotic reading
- [ ] Keep takes tight — no wandering off-script
- [ ] **Keywords from the script must be spoken clearly** (Instagram transcribes audio for SEO)

---

## PHASE 4: B-ROLL SHOOTING (NON-NEGOTIABLE FOR VIRAL CONTENT)

Short, crisp shots make editing faster. Screen must change **every 3-5 seconds** for visual engagement.

- [ ] Follow the shot list's B-roll section exactly
- [ ] **Minimum 10-15 B-roll clips per product/shoot**
- [ ] All B-roll shot in **9:16 vertical**

### Standard B-Roll Pack (Always Include):
- [ ] Product wide shot
- [ ] Product close-up
- [ ] Gear shifting close-ups
- [ ] Tyres / suspension / components
- [ ] Logo / branding close-up
- [ ] Riding shot (10 seconds, stable)
- [ ] Hands touching product (handlebar, frame, seat)
- [ ] Store environment (clean, well-lit)
- [ ] Customer browsing
- [ ] Price card or brand tag
- [ ] Signature "Syed bicycle shot" (unique style clip)
- [ ] Any unique detail from the reference reel

### Additional B-Roll Types (NEW):
- [ ] **Lifestyle / emotion shots:** Customer reaction, happy rider moment, satisfaction expression
- [ ] **POV shots:** First-person riding, first-person walking through store, first-person unboxing
- [ ] **Slow-motion shots:** Gear shifting, wheel spinning, suspension bounce (for pacing variation in edit)
- [ ] **Text-safe shots:** 2-3 clips with clean/minimal backgrounds specifically for text overlay
- [ ] **Before/after shots:** If applicable (old vs new, stock vs upgraded)

### B-Roll Quality Rules:
- [ ] Store is **clean and tidy** before shooting
- [ ] **Proper lighting** used for all B-roll
- [ ] **Different angles** used (don't shoot everything from the same position)
- [ ] Clips are short and crisp (2-5 seconds each)
- [ ] **B-roll sells the product, not A-roll**

---

## PHASE 5: CTA SHOOTING

- [ ] Shoot each CTA from **2-3 different angles**
- [ ] Shoot each CTA with **different energy levels** (enthusiastic, calm, casual)
- [ ] At least **2-3 CTA versions** filmed:
  - "DM us for details"
  - "Visit our store in [city]"
  - "Follow for more [niche] content"
  - "Send this to your friend who needs this" (share-driving CTA)
- [ ] Editors need variations — don't give them just one option

---

## PHASE 6: THUMBNAIL SHOTS (NEW)

- [ ] Shoot **2-3 dedicated thumbnail frames** — these are NOT random screenshots
- [ ] Requirements for each thumbnail shot:
  - Expressive human face (excitement, surprise, curiosity)
  - Product clearly visible
  - Clean, uncluttered background
  - Good lighting, sharp focus
  - Space for text overlay (rule of thirds — leave room)
- [ ] Shoot one horizontal version too (for YouTube thumbnail if needed)

---

## PHASE 7: VOICEOVER

- [ ] Voiceover recorded **before EOD or at the latest the next day** — don't delay further
- [ ] Quiet room, no background noise
- [ ] Keywords spoken **clearly and naturally** (Instagram indexes speech for SEO)
- [ ] Multiple takes for the editor to choose from
- [ ] Energy matches the script's specified tone

---

## PHASE 8: QUALITY VERIFICATION (Never Leave Location Without This)

### Footage Check:
- [ ] Hook takes saved (all 5-7 versions)
- [ ] Main A-roll takes saved
- [ ] B-roll completed (minimum 10-15 clips)
- [ ] CTA completed (2-3 versions, multiple angles)
- [ ] Thumbnail shots saved (2-3 frames)
- [ ] **No blurry clips** — delete on the spot
- [ ] **No noisy audio** — re-record if needed
- [ ] **All files visible in gallery** — verify before leaving
- [ ] All footage is **9:16 vertical**
- [ ] All footage is **1080x1920 minimum** resolution

### Quick Playback:
- [ ] Play back the best hook take — is it scroll-stopping?
- [ ] Play back audio — is every word clear?
- [ ] Spot-check 3-4 B-roll clips — are they sharp and well-lit?

---

## PHASE 9: IMPORT & ORGANIZE

- [ ] Select **BEST takes** for: Hook, A-roll, B-roll, CTA, Thumbnail
- [ ] Raw footage imported into a **labeled folder** in Google Drive
- [ ] Folder structure:
  ```
  [Date] - [Product/Topic]
  ├── Hook Takes
  ├── A-Roll (Main)
  ├── B-Roll
  ├── CTA Takes
  ├── Thumbnail Shots
  └── Reference Reel
  ```
- [ ] Upload B-rolls to master folder and name as **"B roll"**
- [ ] Reference reel added on **Notion** with all basic details
- [ ] Update **Google Sheet** by EOD
- [ ] **Delete shaky / blurry / unusable clips** — don't clutter the editor's workspace
- [ ] Group clips into: **Hook → Main → B-roll → CTA → Thumbnail**

**If clips aren't organized, the editor cannot recreate viral precision.**
