# IDEA CHECKLIST (Updated Feb 2026)

**Rule: Idea must score 8/10 or higher. Never shoot average ideas.**

**Color Code: Red = Mandatory | Yellow = Super Mandatory**

---

## SECTION 1: VIRAL REFERENCE VALIDATION

- [ ] Content must be a reference of a **viral reel** — viral = **2X-10X** the normal views of that page
- [ ] The **reason for virality** is clearly identified and documented
- [ ] What **emotion** made it viral? (Choose ONE dominant emotion):
  - Sad / Humor / Surprise / Anger / Aspiration / Curiosity
- [ ] **If emotion is not clear → REJECT the idea immediately**
- [ ] It should be **easy to replicate** the idea without missing the reason for virality
- [ ] Is the trend still timely? Are we **capturing it before it's too late?**

---

## SECTION 2: HOOK VALIDATION (Super Mandatory)

The hook determines everything. 94% of Instagram distribution is algorithm-driven, and the algorithm decides in the first 1.7 seconds.

**Reference:** [ON-SCREEN TEXT HOOK CHECKLIST](ON-SCREEN%20TEXT%20HOOK%20CHECKLIST%20%E2%80%94%20UPDATED%202026.md) — 10 proven hook formulas, design specs, and the 3-layer hook system.

- [ ] Hook = **Visual hook + Audio hook + On-screen text hook + SFX hook** (all 4 required)
- [ ] **If the hook is weak → REJECT the idea**
- [ ] Can the hook stop someone mid-scroll in 1.7 seconds?
- [ ] Is the hook under 6-10 words?
- [ ] **Draft screen hook text now** — write the 5-8 word on-screen text hook using one of the 10 proven formulas
  - Screen hook draft: "________________________________________"
  - Hook formula used: ________________ (curiosity gap / bold claim / numbered / problem-solution / etc.)
- [ ] Does the screen hook include the **target keyword** naturally?
- [ ] **5-Second Mute Test (mental):** If this text appeared on a black screen with no audio, would someone stop scrolling?

## SECTION 3: AUDIENCE & BUSINESS FIT

- [ ] Does this idea attract **buyers or random viewers?** → YES / NO
  - If random viewers → REJECT
- [ ] Does it fit at least **one core audience segment?** → YES / NO
- [ ] Does it push the **RIGHT audience to buy?**
- [ ] Target: Reach **10M views** per reel (personal goal)

---

## SECTION 4: SHAREABILITY TEST (NEW — #1 Algorithm Signal)

DM shares are **3-5x more valuable than likes** for reaching new audiences. This must be validated at the idea stage.

- [ ] **"Would someone DM this to a friend?"** → YES / NO
  - If NO → rework the idea until the answer is YES
- [ ] Who specifically would they send it to? (e.g., "riding buddy," "someone looking for a bike," "someone who loves cycling content")
- [ ] What makes it sendable? (relatable, surprising, useful, emotionally resonant)

---

## SECTION 5: SAVE-WORTHINESS TEST (NEW — #3 Algorithm Signal)

Saves indicate lasting reference value. Content people bookmark gets 3x the algorithmic weight of likes.

- [ ] **"Would someone save this to come back to later?"** → YES / NO
- [ ] If YES — what type? (tutorial, comparison, checklist, tips, buying guide)
- [ ] If NO — can the idea be reframed to include reference value?

---

## SECTION 6: CONTENT FORMAT DECISION (NEW)

Different formats serve different algorithm signals. Decide at the idea stage.

- [ ] Which format best suits this idea?
  - **Faceless B-roll + text overlay** → Highest viral potential, works muted, infinitely loopable
  - **Talking head** → Highest trust, best for educational, builds authority
  - **POV / First-person** → Highest shares (people send it to friends who relate)
  - **Before/After / Transformation** → High completion rates (curiosity gap)
  - **Tutorial / How-to with steps** → Highest save rate
  - **Trend participation with niche twist** → Rides trending distribution wave

---

## SECTION 7: INSTAGRAM SEO / SEARCH INTENT (NEW)

50%+ of new Instagram followers now come from search. Every idea should target a searchable term.

- [ ] **"What would someone type into Instagram search to find this content?"**
  - Write the target keyword: ________________
- [ ] Is this keyword relevant to your niche and products?
- [ ] Does the idea naturally incorporate this keyword in the hook/script?

---

## SECTION 8: LOOPABILITY CHECK (NEW)

Reels that loop (7-15 seconds) get replays counted as watch time — compounding the #1 algorithm signal.

- [ ] Can this idea be designed as a short loop (7-15 seconds)? → YES / NO
- [ ] If YES — can the ending flow naturally back into the beginning?
- [ ] Short loop format is ideal for: product reveals, quick tips, satisfying visuals, before/after

---

## SECTION 9: CROSS-PLATFORM POTENTIAL (NEW)

- [ ] Can this idea work on **TikTok?** → YES / NO
- [ ] Can this idea work on **YouTube Shorts?** → YES / NO
- [ ] Can this idea work on **Facebook Reels?** → YES / NO
- [ ] Ideas that work on 3+ platforms multiply your ROI from a single shoot

---

## SECTION 10: FEASIBILITY

- [ ] Idea must be doable — we must have the resources
- [ ] Can be shot within **24-48 hours**
- [ ] A great idea that's impossible = useless
- [ ] Is it **simple enough to execute without Syed?**
- [ ] CTA must be clear
- [ ] Every idea must ensure engagement
