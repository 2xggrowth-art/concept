# SCRIPT CHECKLIST (Updated Feb 2026)

**Rule: Script must score 7/10 or higher. If the hook is weak → script is REJECTED.**

---

## SECTION 1: PRE-SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS

- [ ] Script is based on an **approved idea** (scored 8/10+)
- [ ] Reference reel watched at least **3 times** before writing
- [ ] Viral pacing and intensity understood from reference
- [ ] Target keyword from idea checklist carried forward: ________________
- [ ] Content format confirmed (talking head / B-roll + text / POV / tutorial / etc.)

---

## SECTION 2: HOOK (Under 6-10 Words)

- [ ] Hook is short — **under 6-10 words ideally**
- [ ] Hook creates immediate curiosity or emotional reaction
- [ ] Hook matches one of these proven 2026 formulas:
  - **Curiosity gap:** "I made this one mistake for 3 years..."
  - **Contrarian/bold claim:** "Stop doing [popular thing] — here's what works"
  - **Pattern interrupt:** Start with the most shocking/unexpected visual
  - **Identity hook:** "If you're a [specific identity], you need to hear this"
  - **Problem-solution:** "Struggling with [X]? Here's what changed everything"
- [ ] Hook includes the **target keyword** naturally
- [ ] **If the hook is weak → REJECT the script instantly**

---

## SECTION 3: EMOTIONAL TRIGGER (Mandatory)

Every script must identify **ONE dominating emotion**:

- [ ] Shock
- [ ] Surprise
- [ ] Relatable pain
- [ ] Aspiration
- [ ] Curiosity
- [ ] Humor
- [ ] Satisfaction
- [ ] Other: ________________

**If emotion is not clear → REJECT the script instantly.**

---

## SECTION 4: A-ROLL (Main Points to Speak)

- [ ] Written as **3-5 bullet points ONLY** (not paragraphs)
- [ ] Each point is: **Short + Speakable + High value + Directly related to the hook**
- [ ] NO "hard sales" tone unless the reference uses it
- [ ] Must follow **bullet-point style** (NOT paragraph format)
- [ ] Must be in **local/regional language**
- [ ] Easy for talent to read and deliver
- [ ] No complex words
- [ ] No lines longer than **7-9 seconds** to speak
- [ ] Tone clearly mentioned: fast / calm / funny / emotional
- [ ] Intended energy level specified

### Keyword Scripting (NEW)
- [ ] Target keywords are **written into the spoken dialogue** naturally
- [ ] Instagram transcribes spoken audio and indexes it for search + Google
- [ ] The talent should say the primary keyword **at least once clearly**
- [ ] Secondary keywords woven into 1-2 other bullet points

---

## SECTION 5: RETENTION HOOKS (NEW — Keeps Viewers Past the Opening)

The hook gets them in. Retention hooks keep them watching to the end.

- [ ] Script includes a **"pattern interrupt" moment** every 5-7 seconds:
  - A surprising statement or fact
  - A tonal shift (serious → funny → serious)
  - A "wait, it gets better" transition
  - A question directed at the viewer
- [ ] At least **2-3 retention hooks** built into the script between the opening hook and CTA
- [ ] Example retention hooks:
  - "But here's where it gets interesting..."
  - "And the best part?"
  - "Most people don't know this, but..."

---

## SECTION 6: ON-SCREEN TEXT SCRIPT (Critical for SEO + Scroll-Stopping)

**Full reference:** [ON-SCREEN TEXT HOOK CHECKLIST](ON-SCREEN%20TEXT%20HOOK%20CHECKLIST%20%E2%80%94%20UPDATED%202026.md) — contains hook formulas, design specs, safe zones, and the scriptwriter's text plan template.

Instagram indexes on-screen text overlays via OCR. Google crawls them too. The editor needs to know exactly what text to add.

- [ ] **Hook formula chosen** from the 10 proven formulas (see On-Screen Text Hook Checklist, Section 3)
- [ ] **Screen hook text drafted** — 5-8 words, includes primary keyword, creates curiosity/emotion
- [ ] **Spoken hook drafted** — different phrasing from screen hook, complements it (don't duplicate)
- [ ] **Caption hook drafted** — third phrasing of the same idea, keyword in first 125 characters
- [ ] Script specifies **what text appears on screen** at each point
- [ ] Text overlays include **target keywords**
- [ ] Format for each text note:
  - **When:** (e.g., "at 0:03 when talent says...")
  - **What text:** (e.g., "Best Mountain Bike Under 15K")
  - **Style:** (e.g., "bold, highlight keyword in yellow")
- [ ] Screen hook text specified (if using text-only opening instead of subtitles)
- [ ] **Scriptwriter's Text Plan template filled out** (see On-Screen Text Hook Checklist, Section 7)

---

## SECTION 7: SHAREABILITY LINE (NEW)

- [ ] Script includes **one line designed to trigger DM shares**:
  - "Send this to your friend who's been looking for a [product]"
  - "Tag your riding buddy"
  - "Your [friend/partner] needs to see this"
- [ ] This line can be in the CTA or naturally within the main content
- [ ] DM shares are **3-5x more valuable than likes** — this is the #1 algorithm signal

---

## SECTION 8: B-ROLL INSTRUCTIONS (Critical for Editors)

Every script **must** include B-roll notes:

- [ ] **What to show** (product detail, action, environment)
- [ ] **Where to show** (which section of the script)
- [ ] **Which line needs B-roll** (specific bullet point)
- [ ] **Shot type:** Close-up / wide / movement / slow-mo / POV
- [ ] **Reference reel B-roll matched** (what B-roll did the viral reel use?)
- [ ] At least one **text-safe B-roll note** (clean background area for text overlay)
- [ ] At least one **slow-motion B-roll note** (for pacing variation in edit)

---

## SECTION 9: CTA OPTIONS

- [ ] Script includes **2-3 CTA options** for the editor to choose from
- [ ] At least one CTA is **share-driving:** "Send this to someone who..."
- [ ] At least one CTA is **save-driving:** "Save this for when you..."
- [ ] At least one CTA is **action-driving:** "Visit the store" / "Comment [keyword]" / "Link in bio"

---

## SECTION 10: LOOP DESIGN (NEW — For Short Scripts)

For scripts targeting 7-15 second Reels:

- [ ] Does the last line flow naturally back into the first line?
- [ ] Can the viewer seamlessly loop into rewatching without noticing?
- [ ] If yes — mark the script as "Loop-Designed" for the editor
- [ ] Loops compound watch time (replays count toward the #1 algorithm signal)

---

## SECTION 11: TIMING & FORMAT

- [ ] Script fits under **40 seconds** (IG Reels sweet spot)
- [ ] If long format → follows reference timing exactly
- [ ] If short loop format → under 15 seconds
- [ ] Script must include the **shot list** (see Shot List Checklist)
- [ ] Without a shot list, shooting becomes difficult

---

## SECTION 12: ALT TEXT DRAFT (NEW)

The scriptwriter knows the content best. Draft the alt text now so the posting team doesn't have to guess.

- [ ] Write 1-2 sentences describing what happens in the Reel
- [ ] Include the **target keyword** naturally
- [ ] Example: "Close-up of the Hercules Roadeo A375 mountain bike gear system with riding footage on Bangalore trails. Best mountain bike under 15K."

---

## FINAL SCORE: _____ / 10

**Must be 7/10 or higher to proceed to shoot stage.**

### Scoring Guide:
| Section | Points |
|---|---|
| Hook is strong (under 10 words, curiosity-driven) | /1 |
| Emotion is clear and dominant | /1 |
| A-roll is tight (3-5 speakable bullet points) | /1 |

**The entire idea here is to create a seamless process for multiple teams and departments to work without complete dependency.**
