# ON-SCREEN TEXT HOOK CHECKLIST (Updated Feb 2026)

**Rule: If the on-screen text hook is weak, the Reel fails on mute. 85%+ of viewers see your Reel with sound OFF first. The text hook is your #1 scroll-stopper.**

**Who uses this:** Scriptwriter (drafts the hook text) → Editor (designs and places it) → Ops Manager (validates before posting)

---

## WHY ON-SCREEN TEXT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE

1. **Instagram uses OCR** (Optical Character Recognition) to read every word of text on screen in your Reels
2. **Instagram indexes on-screen text for search** — it's treated like an H1 heading on a website
3. **Google crawls it too** — your Reel can appear in Google Search, AI Overviews, and voice search results
4. **85%+ of Reels are initially viewed with sound off** — text is the only thing that stops the scroll for these viewers
5. **Keywords in on-screen text directly affect discoverability** — this replaced hashtags as the primary SEO signal in 2025-2026

---

## SECTION 1: THE THREE-LAYER HOOK SYSTEM (How Text, Voice, and Caption Work Together)

Your on-screen text hook does NOT exist alone. It's part of a coordinated 3-layer system:

| Layer | When It Hits | Purpose | Rule |
|-------|-------------|---------|------|
| **On-screen text** | Frame 1 (0.0-0.5 sec) | STOP the scroll visually | Contains the hook + primary keyword |
| **Spoken hook** | 0.5-1.5 sec | Deliver the promise with voice | Complements text — does NOT repeat word-for-word |
| **Caption hook** | First 125 chars (on tap) | SEO + "See More" trigger | Rephrases the hook with primary keyword |

### The Golden Rule: COMPLEMENT, DON'T DUPLICATE

- **On-screen text:** "This bike shouldn't exist at this price"
- **Spoken hook:** "Bro, you won't believe what I found for under 15K"
- **Caption first line:** "The best mountain bike under 15K that nobody knows about"

Same idea. Three different phrasings. Each includes the keyword naturally. Each works independently. Together they create triple reinforcement for both the viewer AND the algorithm.

### Example (Generic):
- **On-screen text:** "Stop wasting money on this"
- **Spoken hook:** "I wish someone told me this before I spent 50K"
- **Caption first line:** "The biggest money mistake people make when buying [product]"

## SECTION 2: SCREEN HOOK vs. SUBTITLES — WHEN TO USE WHICH

| Content Format | First 3-5 Seconds | After 3-5 Seconds |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Faceless B-roll + text overlay** | Screen hook text (this IS the content) | Continue with text overlays throughout |
| **Talking head** | Screen hook text ONLY (no subtitles yet) | Transition to subtitles |
| **POV / First-person** | Screen hook text to set context | Subtitles during action |
| **Tutorial / How-to** | Screen hook: "3 steps to..." | Subtitles for instructions |
| **Product reveal** | Screen hook: teaser text | Subtitles during explanation |
| **Before/After** | Screen hook: setup text | Subtitles for narration |

**Critical Rule:** Screen hook text and subtitles should NEVER overlap. The screen hook replaces subtitles during its display window (first 3-5 seconds), then subtitles take over.

---

## SECTION 3: THE 10 PROVEN HOOK FORMULAS

### TIER 1 — Highest Performers (Use 70% of the time)

**1. CURIOSITY GAP**
Opens a mental loop the brain NEEDS to close. Viewer must watch to resolve it.

| Generic Template | Niche Example (Bikes/Cycling) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| "This shouldn't exist at this price" | "This bike shouldn't exist at ₹8K" |
| "Nobody talks about this [product]" | "Nobody talks about this second-hand cycle" |
| "I found something insane for under [price]" | "I found something insane for under ₹15K" |
| "What I found inside was shocking" | "What I found inside this old bike was shocking" |

**2. BOLD CLAIM / CONTRARIAN**
Challenges existing beliefs. Triggers a "prove it" response = guaranteed watch time.

| Generic Template | Niche Example |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "Stop buying [popular choice]" | "Stop buying new bikes" |
| "This [cheaper option] beats [expensive option]" | "This ₹10K second-hand bike beats new ones at ₹30K" |
| "Everyone's buying the wrong [product]" | "Everyone's buying the wrong mountain bike" |
| "[Popular advice] is a lie" | "Brand new bikes are a waste of money" |

**3. NUMBERED LIST / DATA-DRIVEN**
Sets clear expectations + provides reference value (drives saves). Numbers stop the scroll because the brain processes them differently than words.

| Generic Template | Niche Example |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "[Number] [things] that [outcome]" | "3 bikes under ₹15K actually worth buying" |
| "[Percentage] of people make this mistake" | "90% of first-time buyers overpay for bikes" |
| "[Number] things to check before buying" | "5 things to check before buying a used bike" |
| "I tested [number] products — here's the winner" | "I tested 10 second-hand bikes — only 2 passed" |

**4. PROBLEM-SOLUTION**
Immediately identifies with the viewer's pain. If they have this problem, they MUST watch.

| Generic Template | Niche Example |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "Struggling to find a good [product]?" | "Struggling to find a good used bike in Bangalore?" |
| "Tired of overpaying for [product]?" | "Tired of overpaying at bike shops?" |
| "Your [product] keeps [problem]? Here's why" | "Your gears keep slipping? Here's the real reason" |
| "Can't find [desired thing]? Watch this" | "Can't find a reliable cycle under ₹10K? Watch this" |

---

### TIER 2 — Strong Performers (Use 25% of the time)

**5. WARNING / MISTAKE HOOK**

| Generic Template | Niche Example |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "Don't buy [product] until you see this" | "Don't buy a cycle until you see this" |
| "This mistake cost me ₹[amount]" | "This one mistake cost me ₹20K on a bike" |
| "Stop doing this to your [product]" | "Stop doing this to your bike chain" |

**6. IDENTITY HOOK**

| Generic Template | Niche Example |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "If you're in [city], watch this" | "If you ride in Bangalore, watch this" |
| "Every [identity] needs to know this" | "Every cyclist needs to know this trick" |
| "First-time [buyers] — listen up" | "First-time bike buyers — listen up" |

**7. SHOCK / SURPRISE**

| Generic Template | Niche Example |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "This ₹[low price] one performs like ₹[high price]" | "This ₹8K bike rides like a ₹50K one" |
| "Look what we found today" | "Look what just came into our store today" |
| "Watch what happens when you [action]" | "Watch what happens when you shift these gears" |

**8. TRANSFORMATION / BEFORE-AFTER**

| Generic Template | Niche Example |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "This was dead. Now look at it" | "This cycle was dead. Now look at it" |
| "₹[amount] turned into THIS" | "₹5K turned into THIS beast" |
| "Same [product]. Completely different [result]" | "Same bike. Completely different ride" |

---

### TIER 3 — Situational (Use 5% of the time)

**9. FOMO / URGENCY**

| Generic Template | Niche Example |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "This won't last long" | "This bike won't last a day in store" |
| "Only [number] left at this price" | "Only 2 left under ₹10K" |

**10. QUESTION HOOK**

| Generic Template | Niche Example |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "Would you [use/buy/try] this?" | "Would you ride this?" |
| "Can you guess the price?" | "Can you guess what this bike costs?" |
| "Which one would you pick?" | "Which one would you pick — left or right?" |

---

## SECTION 4: ON-SCREEN TEXT DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

### A. Typography Rules

| Element | Specification | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Font family** | Sans-serif ONLY — Montserrat, Helvetica, Arial, Poppins, Roboto | Serif/script fonts lose clarity on 6-inch screens |
| **Font weight** | Bold or Semi-Bold | Regular/light weights disappear against video backgrounds |
| **Font size** | Minimum 48-60px in editing software | Anything smaller requires squinting = scroll |
| **Keyword highlight** | Primary keyword in a different color (yellow, brand accent color) | Draws eye to the keyword + signals importance |
| **Max words in hook** | 5-8 words | Must be readable in under 2 seconds |
| **Subtitle blocks** | 1-2 short lines per block | Break longer sentences into sequential blocks |
| **Reading level** | 6th-8th grade level | No jargon, no complex words, plain language |

### B. Safe Zone Placement (1080x1920 Canvas)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            108px TOP BUFFER              │
│         (IG status bar, clock)           │
│                                          │
│  60px ┌──────────────────────────┐ 120px │
│  LEFT │                          │ RIGHT │
│       │    ★ SAFE ZONE ★         │       │
│       │    Place ALL text here    │       │
│       │    Center of screen       │       │
│       │    (Ideal: upper-center   │       │
│       │     to center-center)     │       │
│       │                          │       │
│       └──────────────────────────┘       │
│                                          │
│          320px BOTTOM BUFFER             │
│    (Username, caption, like/share/       │
│     comment buttons, audio credit)       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**In pixels (on 1080x1920 canvas):**
- Top: Keep text below 108px from top edge
- Bottom: Keep text above 1600px from top edge (320px from bottom)
- Left: Keep text past 60px from left edge
- Right: Keep text before 960px from left edge (120px from right)
- **Effective text area: 900px wide x 1492px tall**

### C. Contrast & Visibility Rules

| Background Type | Text Treatment |
|----------------|---------------|
| **Dark/consistent background** | White or bright text, no box needed |
| **Light/consistent background** | Black or dark text, no box needed |
| **Busy/variable background** | Add semi-transparent black box (60-70% opacity) behind text |
| **Moving background** | Add thick stroke/outline (2-3px) + drop shadow |
| **B-roll with mixed lighting** | Always use background box — don't risk readability |

**Rule: If you have to squint or pause to read it on your phone → it fails. Test EVERY text overlay on a real phone before rendering.**

### D. Animation Guidelines

| Do This | Don't Do This |
|---------|--------------|
| Subtle fade-in (0.2-0.3 seconds) | Flashy spinning or bouncing text |
| Gentle pop/scale-up on appear | Multiple different animation styles in one video |
| Clean slide-in from left or bottom | Constant color changes or flashing |
| Static hold with keyword color pop | Text that moves while viewer is trying to read it |
| Consistent animation style across all Reels | Overcomplicated motion graphics |

---

## SECTION 5: TIMING & PACING OF ON-SCREEN TEXT

### Hook Text Timing

| Moment | What Happens |
|--------|-------------|
| **0.0 sec (Frame 1)** | Screen hook text appears — bold, center screen, large font |
| **0.0-0.5 sec** | SFX hits (whoosh, impact, notification sound) |
| **0.5-1.5 sec** | Spoken hook begins (complements the text, doesn't repeat it) |
| **1.5-3.0 sec** | Screen hook text still visible — viewer is reading + hearing the promise |
| **3.0-5.0 sec** | Screen hook text transitions out — subtitles begin |
| **5.0 sec onward** | Subtitles carry the rest of the content |

### Subtitle Text Timing

| Rule | Specification |
|------|--------------|
| **Display time per block** | 2-4 seconds (depending on word count) |
| **Words per block** | 5-10 words maximum per subtitle block |
| **Sync** | Must match spoken audio rhythm exactly — no lag, no lead |
| **Keyword moments** | When a keyword is spoken, it should be highlighted in the subtitle |
| **Transition** | Clean cut between blocks — no overlap, no gap |

### Mid-Video Text Overlays (Retention Hooks)

Add keyword-rich text overlays at these moments:
- **Every 5-7 seconds** for pattern interrupts (matches your existing retention hook strategy)
- **When a new point begins** — text reinforces the point visually
- **On key product features** — product name/spec appears on screen
- **Before the CTA** — final keyword-rich text overlay before call to action

---

## SECTION 6: ON-SCREEN TEXT FOR SEO (Keyword Strategy)

### Where Keywords Must Appear On Screen

| Location | Keyword Requirement | Example |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Screen hook text (0-5 sec)** | Primary keyword | "Best Mountain Bike Under 15K" |
| **Product feature overlay** | Primary or secondary keyword | "Shimano 21-Speed Gears" |
| **Mid-video text overlay** | Secondary keyword | "Perfect for Bangalore Trails" |
| **CTA text overlay (end)** | Primary keyword | "Visit 2XG for the Best Used Bikes" |
| **Thumbnail/cover text** | Primary keyword | "Best MTB Under 15K" |

### Keyword Placement Checklist

- [ ] Primary keyword appears on screen **at least 2 times** during the Reel
- [ ] Primary keyword appears in the **screen hook text** (first 5 seconds)
- [ ] Primary keyword is **highlighted in a different color** when it appears
- [ ] Secondary keywords appear in **mid-video text overlays**
- [ ] Product name / category appears on screen **at least once**
- [ ] Keywords read naturally — **no keyword stuffing** (the text must make sense to a viewer)
- [ ] The same primary keyword also appears in: spoken audio, caption, alt text, and cover text

## SECTION 7: SCRIPTWRITER'S ON-SCREEN TEXT TEMPLATE

For every piece of content, the scriptwriter must fill this out and hand it to the editor:

```
ON-SCREEN TEXT PLAN
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Content Title: _________________________________
Target Keyword: _________________________________
Hook Formula Used: ______________________________ (from the 10 formulas)

(Rephrases the hook, includes primary keyword)
```

---

## SECTION 8: EDITOR'S ON-SCREEN TEXT QUALITY CHECKLIST

---

## SECTION 9: COMMON MISTAKES — THE 10 ENGAGEMENT KILLERS

| # | Mistake | What Happens | Fix |
|---|---------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | **Text outside safe zone** | Cut off by IG UI elements — viewer sees half a word | Use safe zone template every time |
| 2 | **Too many words in hook** | Can't read in 2 seconds — scroll | 5-8 words maximum for hook text |
| 3 | **Weak contrast** | Text invisible on busy backgrounds | Always use shadow/stroke/box on variable BGs |
| 4 | **Script/decorative font** | Unreadable on phone screen | Sans-serif bold only — Montserrat, Poppins, etc. |
| 5 | **Text appears late (>0.5 sec)** | Lost all sound-off viewers | Text must be on Frame 1 |
| 6 | **No keyword in hook text** | Zero SEO value from the most visible text | Primary keyword in every hook text |
| 7 | **Text = exact copy of spoken words** | Feels redundant and boring | Complement, don't duplicate |
| 8 | **Subtitle timing off** | Captions lag or lead audio — frustrates viewers | Sync to speech rhythm exactly |
| 9 | **Inconsistent text position** | Eye has to search the screen — cognitive load | Keep text in same zone throughout |
| 10 | **No on-screen text at all** | Lost 85% of viewers + zero text SEO signal | EVERY Reel needs text — no exceptions |

---

## SECTION 10: SCREEN HOOK GENERATION PROCESS

### Method 1: Manual (Scriptwriter)
1. Identify the content's primary keyword
2. Choose a hook formula from the 10 proven formulas above
3. Write the hook in 5-8 words including the keyword
4. Test: "Would someone stop scrolling to read this?" — if no, rewrite
5. Write the complementary spoken hook (different phrasing)
6. Write the caption hook (third phrasing, keyword in first 125 chars)

### Method 2: AI-Assisted (Editor/Scriptwriter)
1. Upload the final edit to Gemini or ChatGPT
2. Use this prompt:
   > "Analyze this reel and give me 5 scroll-stopping screen hook options. Requirements:
   > - Under 8 words each
   > - Must include the keyword '[YOUR KEYWORD]'
   > - Must create curiosity or emotional reaction
   > - Must work for sound-off viewers
   > - Use these formulas: curiosity gap, bold claim, number-driven, or problem-solution"
3. Select the best option
4. Verify it follows this checklist's design rules
5. Hand to editor with full text plan (Section 7 template)

### Method 3: Reference-Based
1. Watch the viral reference reel 3 times
2. Note the exact screen hook text the reference uses
3. Adapt it for your content/keyword (don't copy — adapt)
4. Ensure your keyword is woven in naturally

---

## FINAL VALIDATION: THE 5-SECOND MUTE TEST

Before rendering any Reel, the editor must run this test:

1. **Mute the video completely**
2. **Play the first 5 seconds**
3. **Ask yourself:**
   - [ ] Did the text make me want to keep watching?
   - [ ] Did I understand what this Reel is about?
   - [ ] Was the text readable without pausing?
   - [ ] Did I see the keyword?
   - [ ] Would I stop scrolling for this?

**If ANY answer is NO → the screen hook needs rework before rendering.**

---

## REFERENCE: 2026 ALGORITHM SIGNALS AFFECTED BY ON-SCREEN TEXT

| Signal | How On-Screen Text Affects It |
|--------|------------------------------|
| **3-Sec Hold Rate** | Strong screen hook = viewer stops scrolling = hold rate 60%+ = 5-10x more reach |
| **Watch Time** | Text hooks + retention text overlays keep viewers reading/watching longer |
| **SEO / Search** | Keywords in text overlays = indexed by Instagram search + Google |
| **Saves** | Numbered lists and "how-to" text overlays drive saves (reference value) |
| **DM Shares** | Emotionally punchy text hooks make people send it to friends |
| **Replays** | Surprising or information-dense text makes viewers rewatch to re-read |
| **Accessibility** | Text makes content accessible to deaf/hard-of-hearing viewers = wider reach |
