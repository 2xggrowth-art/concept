# B-ROLL MASTER CHECKLIST (Updated Feb 2026)

**Rule: B-roll sells the product, not A-roll. No B-roll = no viral edit.**

*This file merges the previous "B rolls file.docx" and "Untitled document.docx" into one definitive checklist.*

## PRE-SHOOT REQUIREMENTS

- [ ] Store is **clean and tidy** before shooting
- [ ] **Proper lighting** set up (natural light preferred, ring light if indoors)
- [ ] All B-roll shot in **9:16 vertical** (never landscape)
- [ ] Resolution: **1080x1920 minimum**
- [ ] Camera/phone lens clean
- [ ] Use **different angles** for every shot (don't shoot everything from one position)
- [ ] Each clip is **short and crisp: 2-5 seconds**
- [ ] **Minimum 10-15 B-roll clips per product/shoot**

---

## CATEGORY 1: PRODUCT B-ROLL (Standard Pack — Always Include)

- [ ] Product **wide shot** (full product in frame, clean background)
- [ ] Product **close-up** (hero detail that makes it special)
- [ ] **Gear shifting** close-ups
- [ ] **Tyres / suspension / components** close-ups
- [ ] **Logo / branding** close-up
- [ ] **Riding shot** (short, stable, 5-10 seconds)
- [ ] **Hands touching product** (handlebar, frame, seat, pedals)
- [ ] **Price card or brand tag** visible
- [ ] **Store environment** (wide shot showing the space)
- [ ] **Customer browsing** (real, natural, not staged-looking)
- [ ] **Signature "Syed bicycle shot"** (unique style clip)
- [ ] Any **unique detail from the reference reel** (match what made the viral reel visual)

---

## CATEGORY 2: LIFESTYLE & EMOTION B-ROLL (NEW)

Emotional B-roll drives shares — the #1 algorithm signal. People share content that makes them feel something.

- [ ] **Customer reaction shot** (genuine surprise, excitement, satisfaction)
- [ ] **Happy rider moment** (riding away with a smile, wind in hair)
- [ ] **Satisfaction shot** (clean gear shift, smooth suspension, perfect brake)
- [ ] **Before/after reveal** (if applicable — old vs new, dusty vs polished)
- [ ] **Unboxing / first touch** (customer seeing the product for the first time)
- [ ] **Group/social moment** (friends checking out the bike together)

---

## CATEGORY 3: POV SHOTS (NEW)

POV (first-person) is one of the top-performing Reel formats in 2026. Highest share rate.

- [ ] **POV riding** (camera mounted or handheld, rider's perspective)
- [ ] **POV walking through store** (customer's eye view of products)
- [ ] **POV unboxing / unpacking** (hands opening, revealing product)
- [ ] **POV inspection** (hands checking gears, tyres, brakes from user perspective)

---

## CATEGORY 4: SLOW-MOTION SHOTS (NEW)

One 2-3 second slow-mo clip between fast cuts creates pacing variation that boosts viewer retention.

- [ ] **Gear shifting** in slow motion
- [ ] **Wheel spinning** in slow motion
- [ ] **Suspension bounce** in slow motion
- [ ] **Riding past camera** in slow motion
- [ ] **Hand touching product** in slow motion (premium feel)

**Tip:** Shoot at 60fps and slow down in edit for smooth slow-mo.

---

## CATEGORY 5: TEXT-SAFE SHOTS (NEW)

The editor needs B-roll clips with clean backgrounds for placing text overlays. Instagram indexes on-screen text for SEO.

- [ ] **2-3 clips with clean/minimal/blurred backgrounds** where text can be placed
- [ ] Ensure the product is visible but there's **open space** (top, bottom, or sides) for text
- [ ] Use shallow depth of field (blurred background) if possible
- [ ] These shots are specifically for: keyword overlays, feature callouts, price tags, CTAs

---

## SHOOTING RULES

### Angles Checklist
For every product, shoot from at least **5 different angles:**
- [ ] Eye level (straight on)
- [ ] Low angle (looking up — makes product look powerful)
- [ ] High angle (looking down — overview/context)
- [ ] 45-degree angle (most natural, conversational)
- [ ] Detail/macro (very close, filling the frame)

### Movement Types
- [ ] **Static** (tripod or steady hands — for text overlay shots)
- [ ] **Slow pan** (left to right across the product)
- [ ] **Tilt** (bottom to top reveal)
- [ ] **Push in** (slowly moving toward the product — builds focus)
- [ ] **Pull out** (slowly moving away — reveals context)
- [ ] **Orbit** (moving around the product — 360 feel)

### Quality Standards
- [ ] No blurry clips — if blurry, reshoot immediately
- [ ] No shaky footage — use stabilization or a tripod
- [ ] Consistent lighting across all clips
- [ ] Product is clean (no dust, fingerprints, smudges)
- [ ] Background is not distracting

---

## POST-SHOOT B-ROLL CHECKLIST

- [ ] All B-roll clips reviewed on-site before leaving
- [ ] Unusable clips deleted (blurry, shaky, badly lit)
- [ ] Best clips selected and organized
- [ ] Uploaded to master folder labeled as **"B roll"**
- [ ] File naming convention: `[Product]_Broll_[Type]_[Number]` (e.g., `Hercules_Broll_Closeup_01`)
- [ ] **Minimum 10-15 usable clips** delivered to editor

---

## MINIMUM B-ROLL DELIVERY COUNT

| Type | Minimum Clips |
|---|---|
| Product (standard pack) | 8 |
| Lifestyle / emotion | 2 |
| POV | 1 |
| Slow-motion | 2 |
| Text-safe | 2 |
| **TOTAL MINIMUM** | **15 clips per shoot** |

If the editor runs out of B-roll mid-edit, the final product suffers. **Always overshoot. 20+ clips is ideal.**
