# BULLETPROOF EDIT CHECKLIST (Updated Feb 2026)

**Rule: If the hook is weak, the entire video fails. Do not render.**

---

## PHASE 1: PRE-EDIT SETUP

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Project resolution set to **1080x1920 (9:16 vertical)** minimum — anything below this gets penalized by Instagram
- [ ] Frame rate: 30fps minimum
- [ ] Confirm all raw footage is vertical (9:16) — never crop landscape to vertical
- [ ] Reference reel downloaded and placed on a separate timeline for side-by-side matching

### Assets Collected
- [ ] Best hook takes (from organized folder)
- [ ] Best A-roll takes (main talking points)
- [ ] All B-roll clips
- [ ] CTA takes (2-3 versions)
- [ ] Thumbnail-dedicated shots (face + product + clean background)
- [ ] Reference reel link and notes

---

## PHASE 2: HOOK EDITING (Most Critical — First 3-6 Seconds)

### The 1.7-Second Rule
Users decide to stay or scroll in **1.7 seconds**. The first frame must stop the scroll.

- [ ] First frame is visually striking — not a blank, not a fade-in, not a talking head mid-sentence
- [ ] **5-6 cuts minimum** within the first 5-10 seconds
- [ ] Match the reference reel's pacing exactly (if viral replication)
- [ ] Add SFX in the **first 1-2 seconds** (whoosh, impact, notification — start with a viral SFX)
- [ ] Cut any breathing gap before the first word — content starts IMMEDIATELY
- [ ] Strong visual pattern interrupt in first frame (zoom, motion, unexpected shot)

### 3-Second Hold Rate Target: 60%+
Reels with a 3-second hold rate above 60% get **5-10x more reach** than those below 40%. Design the first 3 seconds to be impossible to scroll past.

- [ ] First 3 seconds have: movement + text + sound (triple-layer hook)
- [ ] On-screen text appears within **first 0.0-0.5 seconds** (curiosity-driven, keyword-rich)
- [ ] Audio hook hits immediately (voice or SFX — no silence)
- [ ] **Run the 5-Second Mute Test** before rendering (see [On-Screen Text Hook Checklist](ON-SCREEN%20TEXT%20HOOK%20CHECKLIST%20%E2%80%94%20UPDATED%202026.md) — Final Validation)

---

## PHASE 3: SUBTITLE & ON-SCREEN TEXT (SEO-Critical in 2026)

### Subtitle Rules
- [ ] Subtitles start from the first frame after 1.5 seconds, OR use screen hook text for first 5-6 seconds
- [ ] **Bold, clean, high-contrast** font — check viral creators for reference (font, style, size)
- [ ] Every **keyword highlighted** in a different color/style (understanding what is a keyword is critical)
- [ ] No spelling mistakes
- [ ] No unnecessary long sentences
- [ ] 1-2 emojis used ONLY if the reference uses them
- [ ] Subtitles do not overlap with IG UI elements (username, like button, caption area)

### Instagram SEO Through Text
**Full reference:** [ON-SCREEN TEXT HOOK CHECKLIST](ON-SCREEN%20TEXT%20HOOK%20CHECKLIST%20%E2%80%94%20UPDATED%202026.md) — contains safe zone specs, design rules, and editor's quality checklist.

Instagram uses OCR to index on-screen text for search. Google crawls it too.

- [ ] **Target keywords appear in on-screen text overlays** — not just random text
- [ ] Primary keyword appears on screen **at least 2 times** during the Reel
- [ ] Key product name / category appears on screen at least once
- [ ] Text overlays are readable on mobile (minimum 48-60px, sans-serif bold, high contrast)
- [ ] Screen hook text includes the primary keyword
- [ ] All text is within the **safe zone** (108px top, 320px bottom, 60px left, 120px right)
- [ ] On-screen text **complements** spoken audio — does NOT duplicate word-for-word
- [ ] **Editor's On-Screen Text Quality Checklist passed** (see On-Screen Text Hook Checklist, Section 8)

---

## PHASE 4: AUDIO & MUSIC

### Audio Quality
- [ ] Good audio = premium content. Bad audio = instant scroll.
- [ ] Cut any breathing gaps, "ums," dead air before the first word
- [ ] Audio levels consistent throughout (no sudden loud/quiet jumps)
- [ ] Voiceover is **clean and clear** — every word must be understandable because Instagram transcribes and indexes spoken audio for search
- [ ] If voiceover has target keywords, ensure they are spoken clearly (this is SEO)

### Music / BGM Selection
- [ ] Viral music / BGM is a **MUST** for virality
- [ ] Music must match the content emotionally:
  - Emotional content = emotional song
  - Sad content = sad song
  - Hype content = high-energy track
  - If emotional tone doesn't match = it hurts performance (Instagram uses sentiment analysis)
- [ ] **Check Instagram's "Trending" indicator** in the audio library — use trending sounds within 24-72 hours of their rise for max distribution boost
- [ ] If music selection isn't top-notch → **do not render. Ask for approval.**
- [ ] Music volume balanced with voiceover (voice always dominant)

---

## PHASE 5: CUTTING & PACING

### Cut Rules
- [ ] Cuts must be **FAST** — no dead moments
- [ ] No clip longer than **1.5-2 seconds** unless specifically needed for a slow-mo moment
- [ ] Use maximum B-rolls wherever the speaker is making a point — always show what is said
- [ ] Screen must change **every 3-5 seconds** for visual engagement
- [ ] Match the exact energy of the viral reference

### Retention Hook Strategy (NEW — Keeps Viewers Past the Hook)
The hook gets them in. Retention hooks keep them watching.

- [ ] Add a **pattern interrupt every 5-7 seconds** throughout the video:
  - Sudden zoom or angle change
  - New B-roll cut
  - Text animation change
  - SFX hit
  - Tonal shift (fast → brief slow moment → fast again)
- [ ] Use **pacing variation**: fast-fast-SLOW-fast-fast. One 2-3 second slow-mo beauty shot between fast cuts spikes retention more than constant fast cutting
- [ ] If retention drops mid-video (check after posting), add more mid-video pattern interrupts in future edits

### Transitions
- [ ] Keep transitions smooth — **simple cuts > fancy transitions**
- [ ] Match transition style to reference reel
- [ ] Consistency: use the same 1-2 transition types throughout (don't mix 5 different effects)

---

## PHASE 6: B-ROLL USAGE

- [ ] B-rolls used wherever the speaker makes a point — **always show what is said**
- [ ] B-roll sells the product, not A-roll
- [ ] If there are **no relevant B-rolls** → do not guess. Ask for approval (Varun asks Syed, then proceed)
- [ ] B-roll clips are short and crisp (under 2 seconds each)
- [ ] Include at least one slow-motion beauty B-roll shot for pacing variation

---

## PHASE 7: LOOPABILITY (NEW — For Short-Form Reels)

For Reels under 15 seconds, looping = replays = compounded watch time = #1 algorithm signal.

- [ ] Does the ending flow naturally back into the opening? If yes, the Reel will loop seamlessly
- [ ] No hard ending (no black frame, no fade out, no "thanks for watching")
- [ ] Last frame should visually or audibly connect to the first frame
- [ ] Test the loop: play the Reel 3x in a row — does it feel continuous?
- [ ] If the content allows it, design the edit for infinite loop

---

## PHASE 8: CTA EDITING

- [ ] CTA is clear and visible
- [ ] CTA appears in **3 places simultaneously** for maximum impact:
  1. On-screen text at the end
  2. Voiceover in the final 2-3 seconds
  3. (Caption — handled by posting team)
- [ ] 2-3 CTA variations edited (editor provides options to posting team)
- [ ] CTA text uses **share-driving language** when possible:
  - "Send this to someone who needs this"
  - "Tag your riding buddy"
  - (DM shares are 3-5x more valuable than likes — this is the #1 algorithm signal)

---

## PHASE 9: BRANDING

- [ ] Second-hand logo placed on **top right corner** (for second-hand content)
- [ ] Branding should be **invisible but powerful** — don't overshadow content
- [ ] Logo size: visible but not distracting (small, semi-transparent if needed)
- [ ] Consistent placement across all Reels

---

## PHASE 10: THUMBNAIL / COVER FRAME (NEW — Separate Marketing Asset)

Your thumbnail is NOT just a frame from the video. It's a separate marketing piece.

- [ ] Design a **custom thumbnail** using dedicated thumbnail shots (or create in Canva)
- [ ] **Bold, readable headline text** on the cover that communicates what the Reel is about
- [ ] Headline text includes a **target keyword** (Instagram indexes cover text for search)
- [ ] All critical elements (text, face, product) sit inside the **center square zone** — IG crops to 1:1 on your profile grid
- [ ] Human face with expression included (outperforms text-only or product-only covers)
- [ ] High contrast, clean design — readable on small mobile screens
- [ ] Consistent brand template matching your other Reel covers
- [ ] Test: does this thumbnail make someone want to tap? If not, redesign.

---

## PHASE 11: SHAREABILITY TEST (NEW — Final Edit Gate)

Before rendering, ask these 3 questions:

- [ ] **"Would someone DM this to a friend?"** — If no, the edit needs a stronger emotional punch, surprise, or relatability factor. DM shares are the #1 algorithm signal.
- [ ] **"Would someone save this to come back to later?"** — If no, consider adding more reference value (tips, lists, how-to elements). Saves are the #3 signal.
- [ ] **"Would someone watch this twice?"** — If no, the pacing or surprise element needs work. Replays compound watch time.

If all 3 answers are NO → the edit needs rework before rendering.

---

## PHASE 12: FINAL QUALITY CHECK

### Content Tightness
- [ ] Total duration under **45 seconds** (or approved for longer format)
- [ ] First 10 seconds are extremely tight — zero wasted frames
- [ ] No dead air, no filler, no repeated points
- [ ] Every second earns its place in the edit

### Technical Quality
- [ ] Export resolution: **1080x1920 minimum**
- [ ] No blurry or pixelated frames
- [ ] No audio pops, clicks, or level jumps
- [ ] Subtitles synced correctly with audio
- [ ] No visual glitches or compression artifacts
- [ ] Color grading matches reference reel tone

### Reference Match
- [ ] Watch the final edit side-by-side with the reference reel
- [ ] Pacing matches? Audio energy matches? Visual feel matches?
- [ ] If it doesn't "feel" like the viral reference → re-edit

---

## PHASE 13: EXPORT & HANDOFF

### Multi-Platform Export (NEW)
- [ ] **Version 1 — Instagram Reel:** Full edit with trending audio/BGM
- [ ] **Version 2 — YouTube Shorts:** Version without copyrighted music (use royalty-free alternative)
- [ ] **Version 3 — TikTok:** Clean version, no watermarks, consider platform-native trending sound
- [ ] **Version 4 — Facebook Reel:** Same as IG version or slightly adjusted
- [ ] All versions are **watermark-free** (Instagram suppresses TikTok watermarks — confirmed)

### Handoff to Posting Team
- [ ] All versions uploaded to designated folder
- [ ] Thumbnail/cover frame exported as separate image (1080x1920)
- [ ] **Alt text draft provided** with target keywords (1-2 sentences describing the Reel for accessibility + SEO)
- [ ] Editor notes: suggested trending audio, keyword recommendations, any flags
- [ ] Reference reel link included in handoff

---

## SCREEN HOOK PROCESS (Clarified)

When using a screen hook (text-only opening instead of subtitles):

1. Upload the final edit to Gemini
2. Use this prompt: "Analyze this reel and give me 5 scroll-stopping screen hook options (under 8 words each) that create curiosity and make viewers stop scrolling. The hook should include the keyword [YOUR KEYWORD]."
3. Select the best option
4. Design: Bold text, center screen, high contrast, large font
5. Display for 5-6 seconds before transitioning to main content with subtitles
6. Screen hook replaces subtitles for the first 5-6 seconds ONLY
