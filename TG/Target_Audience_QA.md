# Target Audience Research Q&A - Bharath Cycle Hub

## Initial Request

**Q: I want to deeply study my target audience, can you help me create a mind map? Do you have any connector that will help me with this?**

A: I'd be happy to help you create a mind map for studying your target audience! To clarify about "connectors" - I don't have specific third-party mind mapping tool integrations, but I can create a mind map for you directly using my computer capabilities. I can build you an interactive, visual mind map as either:
1. Interactive HTML/React artifact - a clickable, expandable mind map
2. Mermaid diagram - a structured mind map
3. SVG visualization - a custom visual mind map

Before I create it, let me ask you a few questions to make it more tailored to your needs:
1. What industry/product/service is your target audience for?
2. Do you already have some audience segments in mind, or should I help you brainstorm the main categories to explore (demographics, psychographics, behaviors, pain points, goals, etc.)?
3. Do you prefer:
   - An interactive mind map you can click and expand?
   - A comprehensive static visual you can view all at once?

## About Your Current Audience

**Q: Do you have customers already? Who are they?**

**Q: What patterns do you see among your best customers?**

A: Excitement, eagerness to showoff, FOMO. Parents are the biggest blockers as they are afraid of a lot of things majorly about the safety of their kid. And there is one common thing among my buyers - they want to see their kids happy, they have come up with struggle and they don't want their kids to face the same, they want to fulfill all their kids desire.

**Q: What patterns do you see among customers who churn or don't convert?**

A: They are skeptical, not easy to win over trust, they are very money conscious, and very calculative.

**Q: Any surprising customer types you didn't expect?**

A: People who make less than 20K a month are buying electric cycle for their kids, all to fulfill their kids desire - they go with the EMI options. This surprises me - an auto rickshaw guy buying an electric cycle for his kid - it amuses me.

A: Instagram we have 8 different profiles, YouTube we have 8 different profiles, we are very strong on social media - we are on the top 1% in the industry as we have this 1M base, and more shocking is that we are looking out for options to grow further, this hunger separates us from the competition.

**Q: What's working well? What's not working?**

A: Social media is working well, ads we haven't tried yet.

**Q: What channels have you tried but abandoned? Why?**

A: Print media or local marketing doesn't work, as this is not an aspirational product or a product that will be daily needed nor it is now adding to the status value.

**Q: What would you like to achieve with positioning?**

A: I want to position a category of the product in the status value perception position.

**Q: What geographic markets do you serve?**

A: Bangalore is our full playground - Yelahanka is where our store is located.

## Phase 3 Validation - Real Pain Points at Sales Counter

### For Parents - Top Objections

**Q: What are the TOP 3 objections you hear most often when parents are deciding whether to buy?**

A:
1. Servicing is a pain - clients are from very far off locations so this is a big issue
2. Sometimes investing this big amount is also an issue
3. Safety of the kid, maintenance of the kid

**Q: Tell me about a recent customer who ALMOST bought but walked away. What stopped them?**

A: We have to improve on the in-store presentation, sales pitch, our sales staff attitude, our approach towards the customer - this will optimize us 5%.

**Q: What makes parents hesitate even when the kid is begging?**

A: Price, and trust over the product, brand, us, or the service issue - the distance issue, as they live very far off and we aren't able to service them.

**Q: Have you had parents say things like "My kid will stop using it", "Traffic is too dangerous", "Too expensive", "My parents (grandparents) won't approve"?**

A: They don't say all this but fight over the price, rest all is my understanding.

**Q: What questions do MOTHERS ask vs FATHERS? Any difference in concerns?**

A: Mothers are more on the safety side. Fathers are more on the price side.

**Q: When parents negotiate on price, what reasons do they give?**

A: "We saw you online, we are followers, subscribers, please do discount." Or they usually say "we will bring more clients please do", "we are buying since ages from you please do discount." And sometimes they strictly stick to the budget. Mostly the discount is only 2 to 3%.

### For Kids - What They Say

---

## Phase 3 Validation - Real Aspirations

A: They just want to buy it because kid asked for it. We are good at influencing the kid to force their parent to get them their desire.

**Q: What are the common themes when parents walk in?**

---

## Phase 3 Validation - The Barriers

**Q: What's the #1 reason people DON'T buy even after visiting your store?**

A: We don't win their trust at the store level. Our display needs to be better. Our motive must be well communicated, plus we need to come to a single communication.

**Q: How many people say "I'll think about it" (meaning: can't afford)?**

A: I would say 20% of our walk-ins.

**Q: How many take EMI vs how many can't even qualify for EMI?**

A: Out of 100 - 30% don't qualify for EMI. This is also a big reason that we lose sale.

**Q: What's the most common budget mismatch? (Want ₹56K Doodle, can only afford ₹25K?)**

A: Yes this is also a problem but our sales staff manages this efficiently.

**Q: What's the biggest argument from parents about the purchase?**

A: The biggest argument is "where will you use this - it has 40KM range, will you ride enough to utilize it so much? Is this a sensible investment?" Parents are aware of kids' pattern - they usually buy cool stuff which trends and stop using it once they are over it.

**Q: Do parents ask about helmets?**

A: Yes and we offer it free of cost.

**Q: Do they ask about speed control?**

A: Yes and our E-cycle have custom speed lock feature.

**Q: Do they mention Ola or other bad EV experiences?**

A: Yes they do. And we say "don't worry, you can trust us over the brand. Unlike big brands we will make sure your bicycle is up to time serviced and in condition." We have a 6 days TAT to solve an issue which we will reduce to 2 days within 30 days.

**Q: What makes customers most hesitant?**

A: Majorly clients are most hesitant on the usage of the user. We convince them saying this can be used by multiple people of different age and for different use-case.

## Phase 3 Validation - Success Stories

**Q: Do people who are extremely liquid also go with EMI?**

A: Yes, people who are extremely liquid also go ahead with EMI - this sometimes surprises me.

**Q: What happens during test ride that seals the deal?**

A: The excitement of using the power of throttle, and magic twist of pedal assists. Our E-bikes have 3 to 5 levels of pedal assists that makes it a magic bike.

**Q: What do kids say after riding?**

A: They say they want it, very excited and very confident on the intent to buy.

**Q: What do parents' faces look like?**

A: They don't get a chance to complain.

**Q: Any customers who DIDN'T experience the 3-month drop? What was different about them?**

A: Their kid integrated it in his daily commute. Let me tell you - kids who use it regularly for school, tuition and other stuff recommend others too. We have 20% kids using it regularly. They are gold as they also come back for servicing and are our big promoters. The more they ride, the more we can sell. Our objective must be to make the kids ride more.

**Q: What's the most common service issue?**

A: The most common service issue is mechanical wear out, due to the increase in the average speed and average usage - the wear out becomes faster.

A: Most of the times son wins, then father.

**Q: What argument typically wins the day?**

A: Where will the kid ride it and why he wants such an expensive gift. Also one time I told the client "why do you want to buy PlayStation, buy an electric cycle at the same budget" - told him about the issues of extensive use of games and screentime. He got convinced.

## Phase 4 Key Insights - Behavioral Patterns Summary

### The Perception Value Advantage

"Our CONTENT makes them buy from us. There is a PERCEPTION VALUE in the client's mind. We are already ABOVE market and competition."

What This Means:
- BCH charges MORE than competitors (₹2K+ premium)
- Customers KNOW BCH is more expensive
- They STILL buy from BCH because content creates premium perception
- Content = Price Justification Engine
- Don't compete on price - compete on perceived value

### Kannada Content Always Wins

Not "performs better" - ALWAYS WINS.
- Kannada-first, not bilingual
- English = alienates core audience
- Regional pride = purchase driver

### The 6-Second Rule

"Entertainment in first 6 seconds"
- Not education. Not features. Not benefits.
- ENTERTAINMENT = Survival
- This explains why MVP video worked (entertaining from second 1)
- Educational content gets skipped

### Rich Customer Psychology

- They negotiate for "round figures" not savings (₹56,000 → "Make it ₹55,000")
- Not about money, about psychological "win"
- Decision Speed: 20 minutes (fastest segment)

### Middle-Class Conviction Formula

"The NEED + Value PERCEPTION" convinces them
- Not price alone. Not features alone.
- NEED (urgency) + VALUE (worth it) = Purchase
- Negotiation: 10 minutes

### Silent Watchers > Loud Engagers

- Low Engagement ≠ Low Impact
- Few comments, few interactions
- BUT: They watch and buy
- Don't chase engagement metrics
- Chase WATCH TIME and REACH
- Silent watchers = actual buyers

### Post-Purchase = Phone Calls

- Not WhatsApp. Not DMs. Not Instagram.
- They call directly
- Phone support is CRITICAL
- WhatsApp for pre-sale, phone for post-sale

### Customer Behavior by Segment

**Rich (37%):**
- 20-min decisions
- Round figure negotiations
- Accessories included in deal
- Fastest converters

**Middle-Class (28%):**
- 10-min negotiations
- Need + Value Perception = conviction
- Want to feel smart about purchase
- Will pay premium if justified

**Budget (35%):**
- 30% can't qualify for EMI (18% total loss)
- 40% of those who can't qualify still buy cash
- Entry-level focus but some stretch to premium

## Phase 5: Psychological Drivers - Questions

A: I think they are imagining the picture of being free, treated as an adult, riding long distance, showing it to their friends.

A: No, they don't cry.

**Q: When parents say "I didn't have this as a child" - what emotion is in their voice?**

A: Sadness and determination and pride that now they can afford this.

**Q: Do parents ever say things like "I don't want my kid to feel poor/left out like I did"?**

A: Hmm, they simply get them their big toys and feel this (implied but not said directly).

**Q: The "good parent" identity - do parents ever explicitly say "I want to be a good parent" or "My kid deserves this"?**

A: Their way of saying "I love you my kid", and their way of saying "we are successful as a family."

### Section 3: Fear Psychology

**Q: When mothers worry about safety, what are they REALLY afraid of?**

A:
- Death/serious injury: 10%
- Looking like a bad mother who let something happen: 50%
- Losing control over kid's whereabouts: 40%

**Q: The "kid will stop using it" fear - what's the deeper fear?**

A: Wasting money, then the spouse saying "I told you so."

A: Being seen as irresponsible with money.

**Q: Do parents ever express fear that the cycle will make their kid lazy, spoiled, or less focused on studies?**

A:
- Lazy (dependent on motor): 50%
- Spoiled/entitled: 10%
- Less focused on studies: 40%
- They don't express this openly.

### Section 4: Identity & Transformation

**Q: When a kid imagines themselves WITH the cycle, who do they imagine becoming?**

A: The cool guy, an identity that every kid needs - a socially praised kid - "basically the winner."

**Q: Do kids ever say things like "Then I'll be like [friend's name who has cycle]"?**

A: Nope, they don't say that.

**Q: For parents, when they buy the cycle, what kind of parent do they feel they're becoming?**

- Successful parent: 10%
- Caring parent: 10%
- Progressive parent: 30%

**Q: The "Future Smart PM" positioning - what resonates with parents?**

A: The leadership angle and the future success angle.

### Section 5: Instant Gratification vs Delayed

**Q: For kids who want it NOW vs parents who want to wait - what's the psychological difference?**

A: Kids fear "friend will get better one if I wait" - this is not spoken but is a powerful fear.

**Q: When parents finally say YES after months of kid asking - what breaks them?**

A:
- Exhaustion from begging: 30%
- Kid's birthday making it "justified": 30%
- Seeing kid sad/disappointed one too many times: 40%

A lot of parents come and tell us that their kid didn't let them work, eat or do anything. And a lot of kids watch our YouTube videos for hours together.

### Section 6: Social Comparison Psychology

**Q: When kids compare cycles, what are they really comparing?**

A: When they compare they want something big, massive, like the big monster truck for adults. Doodle being the most expensive yet it is the most sold - this proves this logic.

**Q: If a kid has the "best" cycle in their friend group, what does that mean to them psychologically?**

A: They are above all their friends.

**Q: What does premium e-cycle ownership signal?**

A: See also, whatever the rich is buying today the poor will follow. With this logic, the rich will want to show that "my kid drives a premium E-cycle." Cycle as a product doesn't elevate status, so E-cycle does. There is a SKU Aoki Flex CR - it is the smallest, fastest, and the lightest E-cycle. People are buying this crazy for their kids below 12yrs. This validates the point.

**Q: The cousin/friend who bought a cycle (FOMO trigger) - what emotion drives the purchase?**

A: I don't know what triggers the FOMO - but I'm sure it's the competitive feeling.

### Section 7: Independence vs Control

**Q: When kids talk about wanting a cycle, do they ever mention "freedom" or "going wherever I want"?**

A: No, they don't mention it. Some things are hidden from parents.

**Q: For parents who buy because "my kid needs independence" - what are they really saying?**

A:
- Kid is growing up (accepting reality): 30%
- I trust my kid (pride): 30%
- I'm a good parent who gives freedom (identity): 30%

### Section 8: Scarcity & Urgency Psychology

**Q: When you say "only 3 Doodles left" - what happens to the customer's behavior?**

A: Urgency must be created - this is not a product that the client uses daily, neither it is a product like mobile devices that customer doesn't live without.

**Q: Birthday/occasion deadlines - does having a fixed date make parents more decisive?**

A: Yes, birthday sale is big. They sometimes extend budget too.

### Section 9: Value Perception Psychology

**Q: You said "content creates perception value" - what does that perception make them believe?**

A:
- BCH is more trustworthy: 30%
- BCH products are better quality: 20%
- BCH is the "expert/authority": 30%

**Q: When customers pay more than competition, what are they really buying?**

A: We don't charge 2K more, it was the max difference but we always make sure we offer the highest value to the client. It can be in different ways:
- Better service: 10% (as they know we are far from their location)
- Trust/safety: 20%
- Social proof (everyone shops at BCH): 40%
- The BCH "brand": 30%

**Q: The "15 free accessories" - even though included in price, what psychological effect does "free" have?**

A:
- Feels like getting a bonus: 33%
- Reduces guilt about spending: 33%
- Makes them feel smart (got a deal): 33%
- All of this - plus the value of the accessories is close to 5% of the sale price. This is very calculatively planned and procured to increase the perceived value of the sale.

### Section 10: Belonging & Community

**Q: If BCH Riders Club existed, what would make a kid WANT to join?**

A: Being part of the cult - kids desire to be treated as an adult, and we can do rides similar to Royal Enfield but for kids.

**Q: For parents, what would make them support kid joining club?**

A: Kids staying active, and we must make sure it will be something bigger than whatever we have discussed - something bigger cause.

### Section 11: Regret & Justification

**Q: After buying, do parents ever come back and say "Best decision I made" or "I was worried but I'm glad I did it"?**

A: Very few come back saying the best decision. Mostly they move on quietly. The insight is that kids who stop using within 3 months of use - parent won't be happy. If the kid is using it regularly, they are also ready to spend a good amount on servicing.

**Q: The 70% who drop usage after 3 months - do parents feel regret?**

A: They don't mention it.

### Section 12: Pleasure vs Pain Motivators

**Q: What's stronger motivator for parents - Pleasure ("My kid will be so happy") or Pain ("My kid will be left out/sad")?**

A: Both work. Moving TOWARD something good (happiness, activity, health): 49%. Moving AWAY FROM something bad (screens, obesity, loneliness): 51%.

**Q: When you convince someone, are you usually amplifying desire or reducing fear?**

A: Desire works better for us than fear. Then it all becomes like "okay let's try it out and see what happens."

### Section 13: Trust Psychology

**Q: The 3-month customer journey - during those 3 months, what's happening psychologically?**

A: Trust is the biggest factor to close sales.

**Q: Your content being everywhere - does this create social proof, authority, or familiarity?**

A:
- "BCH is successful/popular" (social proof): This is major
- "BCH is the expert" (authority): Next
