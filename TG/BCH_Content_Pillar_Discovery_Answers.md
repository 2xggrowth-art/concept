3. **Online retailers** - Customers mention "online price is less"
4. **Local shops** - "X shop is closer"

Note: "I think our TG is 88% same" - BCH shares target group with competitors but differentiates through content and experience.

**2. What content themes do competitors post about?**

Based on the knowledge base, competitors are significantly underperforming on content:
- **Decathlon:** Multi-category focus, not bicycle-specific content
- **Cycle World:** Multi-branch, multi-city presence but poor content execution
- **All competitors:** Poor at content, marketing, customer service, system implementation, using AI

BCH is described as "the only bicycle store that promotes cycles online on Instagram and YouTube" - competitors are essentially absent from the content landscape.

**3. What are competitors doing well?**

- **Multi-category offerings:** Broader product ranges

- **Proximity:** "X shop is closer" is a common objection

- **Educational content:** "Lot of people still don't know about E-cycle and its benefits"
- **AI utilization:** Competitors not leveraging technology
- **Customer service content:** Not showcasing service excellence

**5. What positioning territory is unclaimed?**

- **Kids' E-cycle Status Symbol:** "Cycle as a product doesn't elevate status, so E-cycle does" - owning the status positioning
- **The "Royal Enfield for Kids" Community:** BCH Riders Club vision is unclaimed
- **Business/Delivery E-cycles:** "People using e-cycle for business purpose" - underexplored by all
- **Screen Time Solution Provider:** Positioning e-cycles as the antidote to screen addiction
- **Celebration Moment Brand:** "We need to make E-cycle a moment of CELEBRATION of an achievement"
- **Celebrity/Character Associations:** "DHONI CYCLE" - character tie-ins are powerful and underused
