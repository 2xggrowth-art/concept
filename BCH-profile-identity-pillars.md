# BCH PROFILE IDENTITY + CONTENT PILLARS

> The "Same-Same" problem ends here. This doc gives each of the 8 BCH profiles a DISTINCT identity — tone, visual style, hook style, content pillars, and clear do/don't rules. If you can't tell which page a reel belongs to within 0.5 seconds, it's wrong.

---

## THE DIFFERENTIATION FRAMEWORK

Every profile is differentiated across 5 axes:

| Axis | What it means |
|------|--------------|
| **Color Signature** | Dominant color that appears in text overlays, thumbnails, borders |
| **Tone of Voice** | How the page "speaks" — personality, language, energy |
| **Hook Style** | How the first 0-3 seconds LOOK and FEEL (different per page) |
| **Editing Rhythm** | Pacing, transitions, effects that define the page's feel |
| **Content Pillars** | What to post (with % allocation) and what NEVER to post |

---

## THE 8 IDENTITIES AT A GLANCE

| # | Profile | Color | Tone | One-Line Identity |
|---|---------|-------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | BCH Main | **Orange + White** | Warm, local, celebratory | "The neighborhood cycle shop that became famous" |
| 2 | Wattson Wheelz | **Electric Blue + White** | Expert friend, practical | "Your e-cycle-obsessed friend who tells you what to actually buy" |
| 3 | BCH 2nd Life | **Green + Earth tones** | Smart money, value-hunter | "The guy who finds Rs. 50K cycles for Rs. 12K and flexes on everyone" |
| 4 | BCH Toyz | **Bright Red + Yellow** | Maximum fun, high-energy | "Where kids lose their minds and parents can't say no" |
| 5 | BCH Lux | **Black + Gold** | Premium but grounded | "Premium cycling, Bangalore pricing" |
| 6 | BCH Doodle | **Rainbow / Multicolor** | Playful, artsy, quirky | "Art meets wheels" |
| 7 | Raleigh x BCH | **Dark Blue + Silver** | Trust-builder, family-first | "The smart choice for families" |
| 8 | Next.BLR | **Mint/Teal + White** | Modern, urban, Bangalore | "Your next ride for your next step" |

### Identity Card

| Element | Definition |

| **Language** | **Kannada-first.** Kannada offer content = 5.9M views. English-only = death. Kannada or Kannada-English mix always. |
| **Hook Style** | Offer numbers smashing onto screen. Family walking in slow-mo. Celebration energy. Kannada text overlays with bold fonts. |
| **Editing** | Fast cuts, celebration music, customer reaction moments, store energy. Not cinematic — RAW and real. |

## PROFILE 2: WATTSON WHEELZ (@wattsonwheelz)

### Identity Card

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Electric Blue + White (tech, electric, clean, future) |
| **Tone** | Expert friend. Not a salesman, not a boring reviewer. The friend who KNOWS e-cycles and tells you what to actually buy. Informational but NEVER boring. |
| **Language** | Kannada-English mix. Tech terms in English, conversational in Kannada. |
| **Hook Style** | Feature close-up → "You didn't know your e-cycle could do THIS." Product-first hooks. E-cycle DOING something unexpected. |
| **Editing** | Smooth transitions between features, ride footage, close-up detail shots, specs/numbers appearing on screen. Cleaner than BCH Main — more polished, less raw. |
| **Thumbnail** | Blue accent, e-cycle hero shot, one stat/number visible (range, price, speed), clean design. |

### Content Pillars

| # | Pillar | % | What it is | Example |
|---|--------|---|-----------|---------|

| 5 | **E-Cycle Lifestyle** | 10% | Future influencer pillar. Calorie burns, food + ride, travel + e-cycle, niche crossovers | "Ate 1000 calories, burned it on the ride back" |

### Do / Don't

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Feature close-ups with specs on screen | Long talking-head reviews |
| Customer testimonials (the 11L format!) | Generic product listing |
| Ride footage with real Bangalore streets | Studio-only content |
| Comparison formats (side-by-side) | Single product in isolation |
| Smooth transitions, polished feel | Raw/shaky store footage (that's BCH Main) |
| Practical info: range, charging time, cost/km | Aspirational lifestyle without substance |

### How This Is DIFFERENT From BCH Main
BCH Main = celebration + entertainment + offers (emotional).
Wattson = expert knowledge + customer stories + e-cycle world (informational-but-engaging).

**If it's an e-cycle OFFER → BCH Main.**
**If it's an e-cycle REVIEW/COMPARISON/RIDE → Wattson.**
**If it's a customer buying an e-cycle and it's EMOTIONAL → BCH Main.**
**If it's a customer USING an e-cycle and it's INFORMATIONAL → Wattson.**

### Posting Target
**5-6 reels/week** (URGENT — views declining 50% due to low frequency) | Post at **6 PM** | Best days: **Tue, Thu, Fri**

---

## PROFILE 3: BCH 2ND LIFE (@2nd_hand_bch)

### Identity Card

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Green + Earth tones (sustainability, eco, second-life, smart money) |
| **Tone** | Smart money energy. NOT "cheap" — SMART. The page for people who find Rs. 50K cycles for Rs. 12K and feel like geniuses. Value-hunter mentality. |
| **Language** | Kannada-English mix. Casual, street-smart. |
| **Hook Style** | TRANSFORMATION: rusty "before" → polished "after." Price SHOCK reveals ("Rs. 48,000 ka cycle... Rs. 11,000 mein"). Quick stock tours — "just dropped." |
| **Editing** | Before/after split screens, price tag reveals with sound effects, quick stock walkthrough tours, satisfying restoration close-ups. |
| **Thumbnail** | Green accent, before/after split OR price comparison, "Rs. X" in big text, transformation visible. |

### Content Pillars

| # | Pillar | % | What it is | Example |
|---|--------|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Stock Updates / New Arrivals** | 30% | What just came in, weekly collection showcases, "just dropped" energy, quick walkthroughs | "15 new arrivals this week — starting Rs. 3,500" |
| 2 | **Transformation Stories** | 25% | Before/after refurbishment, restoration process, "look what we turned this into" | Rusty MTB → polished beast (time-lapse) |
| 3 | **Value Wins** | 20% | "New price vs our price" shock format. Budget cycling victories. Flex energy. | "This costs Rs. 50K new. Yours for Rs. 12K." |
| 4 | **Exchange / Buyback** | 15% | How to sell your old cycle, what BCH pays, exchange process, trade-in awareness | "Your old cycle = Rs. 3,000 off a new one" |
| 5 | **Sustainability / Eco** | 10% | Eco-journey angle, environmental impact, reuse > replace, green messaging | "100+ bikes saved from landfill this month" |

### Do / Don't

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Price shock reveals (new vs refurbished) | Make secondhand feel "lesser" or "cheap" |
| Before/after transformations | Show only the finished product (the JOURNEY is the content) |
| Quick stock tours — fast, energetic | Slow, detailed spec breakdowns |
| "Smart money" positioning | Poverty/budget messaging |
| Green color in every thumbnail/overlay | Colors that look like other BCH pages |
| Weekly "new arrivals" consistency | Random, unscheduled drops |

### URGENT INTERVENTION NEEDED
Reach collapsed -46.9%. Non-follower reach only 46.4% (vs 89% for Toyz). The algorithm is not pushing this content.

**Fix strategy:**
1. Study what BCH Toyz is doing for 89% non-follower reach — replicate hooks
2. Before/after transformation reels (high share potential)
3. Price shock format (triggers saves + shares)
4. Post consistently — every Tue/Thu/Fri at 6 PM minimum

### Posting Target
**4-5 reels/week** (needs consistency to reverse decline) | Post at **6 PM** | Use Tue/Thu/Fri baseline

---

## PROFILE 4: BCH TOYZ (@bch_toyz)

### Identity Card

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Bright Red + Yellow (excitement, toys, kids energy, FUN) |
| **Tone** | MAXIMUM FUN. Pure excitement. Zero boring. The page that makes kids scream and parents give in. Energy > information. Always. |
| **Language** | Minimal text. Music-driven. When text appears, it's BOLD, SHORT, PUNCHY ("₹2,999!" / "BUY 1 GET 1"). |
| **Hook Style** | Kid reaction as hook. Product reveal with engine roar. Size contrast (pocket bike vs adult = instant comedy). Sound-first — engine, screams, crashes, revs. |
| **Editing** | Quick cuts, slo-mo reveals, reaction close-ups, action shots, sound effects HEAVY. Fastest editing pace among all profiles. |
| **Thumbnail** | Red/yellow burst, kid's face reacting OR product in action, bright + chaotic energy, price if offer. |

### Content Pillars

| # | Pillar | % | What it is | Example |
|---|--------|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Product Showcases** | 30% | Ride-ons, pocket bikes, electric jeeps in action. The product IS the content. | Petrol bike video = 1.3M views (TOP!) |
| 2 | **Kid Reactions** | 25% | First ride moments, surprise reveals, kids going CRAZY. The FACE is the content. | Kid sees Mercedes ride-on for first time |
| 3 | **Comedy / Size Gap** | 20% | Adults on pocket bikes, size-mismatch comedy, mass cinema recreations, absurd situations | Mass Series (adult doing Rajinikanth entry on 2-foot bike) |
| 4 | **Offers & Deals** | 15% | Buy 1 Get 1, starting prices (₹2,999), seasonal deals. Drives follower conversion. | "BUY 1 GET 1" = 113 followers from single reel |
| 5 | **Parent Decision Content** | 10% | Safety features, model comparisons, why this ride-on. Speak to the BUYER (parent). | "Mercedes vs BMW ride-on — which one?" |

### Do / Don't

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Kid reactions front and center | Long product spec breakdowns |
| Engine sounds, revs, action audio | Silent/calm background music |
| Slo-mo reveals with dramatic music | Static product shots |
| Size-gap comedy (adult on tiny bike) | Adult-only content without kids |
| Bold price text on offers (₹2,999!) | Burying price in description |
| Fastest cutting pace of all pages | Slow, lingering shots |

### How This Is DIFFERENT From BCH Main
BCH Main = the STORE and its stories. BCH Toyz = the PRODUCT and the REACTION.

**If a kid walks into BCH and it's a heartwarming customer story → BCH Main.**
**If a kid rides a pocket bike and loses their mind → BCH Toyz.**

### Concept Series Assigned
- Pocket Bike series (PB1-PB50) — Zubair & Sami
- Ray-Ban Meta POV series (RM1-RM20)
- Mass Series (MS1-MS33)

### Posting Target
**4-5 reels/week** | Post at **6 PM** | Best days: **Mon, Tue, Thu**

## PROFILE 5: BCH LUX

### Identity Card

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Black + Gold (premium, exclusive, luxury — but not pretentious) |
| **Tone** | Premium but GROUNDED. Not an international cycling magazine. It's "the guy who knows real cycling and found premium bikes at unreal prices in Bangalore." Expert authority + local flavor. |
| **Language** | **Kannada-English mix. NEVER English-only** (killed reach before — this was the #1 mistake). Tech terms in English, personality in Kannada. |
| **Hook Style** | Detail-first. Carbon frame close-up. Groupset click. Weight comparison (hold cycle with one finger). The PRODUCT does the talking, not narration. Cinematic mode (iPhone). |
| **Editing** | Cinematic mode iPhone shots, slow reveals, detail macro shots, minimal text, premium color grading (desaturated, high contrast). Slowest pace among all profiles — let the premium breathe. |
| **Thumbnail** | Black background, gold accent text, cycle detail shot (not full cycle — a DETAIL), price only if liquidation. |

### Content Pillars

| # | Pillar | % | What it is | Example |
|---|--------|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Liquidation / Price Destruction** | 35% | IMMEDIATE PRIORITY. Below-cost pricing is the hook. "Rs. 2.5L cycle, walking out at Rs. 1.5L." | Red marker slashing laminated price tag on Polygon Stratos S7 |
| 2 | **Premium Showcases** | 25% | Carbon frames, Shimano groupsets, premium specs. Detail shots that stop enthusiasts mid-scroll. | Macro shot of carbon weave → pan to full cycle → weight reveal |
| 3 | **Why Premium Matters** | 20% | Weight difference (hold with one finger), ride quality demo, frame technology education. Creates desire. | "Regular cycle: 14 kg. This one: 7.2 kg. Feel the difference." |
| 4 | **Cycling Lifestyle** | 10% | Weekend rides, cycling community, the premium cycling identity. Aspirational but LOCAL. | "Sunday morning ride through Bangalore — 60 km, no sweat" |
| 5 | **Premium vs Regular** | 10% | Side-by-side comparisons. "What does an extra Rs. 30K actually get you?" Feature-for-feature. | Shimano Tourney vs Shimano 105 — visual + ride comparison |

### Do / Don't

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Kannada-English mix in EVERY reel | English-only (this killed the page) |
| Cinematic iPhone mode for all product shots | Phone-quality handheld shaky footage |
| Detail macro shots (carbon weave, groupset, brake) | Full-cycle wide shots only |
| Price destruction format for liquidation | Vague "sale" announcements |
| Slow, premium pacing | Fast cuts (that's BCH Toyz territory) |
| Weight comparisons, tangible demonstrations | Spec sheets / number dumping |

### REBOOT PLAN (Phase 1 — First 30 Days)
1. **Reels 1-10:** Pure liquidation content. Price destruction. Red marker on price tags. "Rs. X → Rs. Y." Urgency-driven.
2. **Reels 11-20:** Mix of liquidation + premium showcases. Detail shots with cinematic mode. Build the "premium but accessible" identity.
3. **Reels 21-30:** Full pillar mix. Identity established. Audience knows what this page IS.

### Posting Target
**3-4 reels/week** (reboot phase) | Post at **6 PM** | Start with Tue/Thu

## PROFILE 6: BCH DOODLE

### Identity Card

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Rainbow / Multicolor (artistic, creative, vibrant, one-of-a-kind) |
| **Tone** | Playful, artsy, quirky. The page where a boring cycle becomes ART. Creativity + product = magic. No selling. Just art. |
| **Language** | Minimal. Music-driven. When text appears, it's artistic/stylized. Let the ART speak. |
| **Hook Style** | Blank cycle → first doodle stroke. Time-lapse of art unfolding. The PROCESS of creation is the hook. Close-up of pen hitting metal. |
| **Editing** | Time-lapse process, satisfying close-ups of drawing, before/after reveals, ASMR-adjacent detail shots. Satisfying content — the kind people watch 3 times. |
| **Thumbnail** | Colorful, vibrant, doodle art covering the frame, before/after split, artistic fonts. |

### Content Pillars

| # | Pillar | % | What it is | Example |
|---|--------|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Doodle Process** | 35% | Time-lapse of doodling on cycles. Pen on metal. Art unfolding. The creation IS the content. | 60-second time-lapse: plain white cycle → full doodle art |
| 2 | **Before/After Reveals** | 25% | Plain cycle → doodled masterpiece. The transformation drives shares + saves. | Side-by-side: boring grey cycle → colorful art piece |
| 3 | **Art Showcases** | 20% | Finished doodle products, different themes (festival, movie, cultural, abstract), rotating angles | Slow 360° rotation of completed doodle cycle |
| 4 | **Customer Moments** | 10% | Customers seeing their doodled cycle for the first time. REACTION content. | Customer opens eyes to see their custom doodle — face = content |
| 5 | **Trend Rides** | 10% | Trending audio/formats BUT through doodle lens. Ride the algorithm with doodle twist. | Trending audio + time-lapse doodle = algorithm boost |

### Do / Don't

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Time-lapse process videos | Talking about the doodle (SHOW, don't tell) |
| Satisfying close-ups of drawing | Wide shots that lose detail |
| Trending audio with doodle visuals | Random/generic music |
| Before/after reveals | Only showing finished product |
| Vibrant, colorful everything | Muted, desaturated aesthetics |
| ASMR pen-on-metal sounds | Heavy narration/voiceover |

### REVIVAL STRATEGY
This page went from ALL VIRAL to 20-30K avg views. Diagnosis needed — but likely causes:
1. **Posting inconsistency** — algorithm punishes gaps
2. **Trend fatigue** — doodle trend may have cooled, need FRESH hook styles on same content
3. **Hook weakness** — if every video opens the same way, algorithm stops pushing

**Fix attempts (test these):**
- New hook: Start with FINISHED doodle → "How?" → rewind to process (curiosity loop)
- New hook: Doodle that looks like a famous character/meme/trend → recognition hook
- New hook: Close-up of ONE detail being drawn → zoom out to reveal full art
- Increase posting to 3-4/week minimum
- Ride EVERY trending audio with a doodle twist

### Posting Target
**3-4 reels/week** | Post at **6 PM** | Dashboard data needed to confirm best days

## PROFILE 7: RALEIGH x BCH (@raleighxbch)

### Identity Card

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Dark Blue + Silver (trust, reliability, premium-but-accessible, Raleigh brand alignment) |
| **Tone** | Trust-builder. Family-friendly. The page that makes you CONFIDENT Raleigh is THE e-cycle to buy. Not aggressive sales — earned trust through proof. |
| **Language** | Kannada-English mix. Warm, family-oriented. Feature terms in English, emotion in Kannada. |
| **Hook Style** | Feature demonstrations — not spec lists, but the feature DOING something. Customer celebration moments. Trust signals ("2 YEARS WARRANTY" on screen). |
| **Editing** | Clean, feature-focused, customer story arcs, gift/unboxing moments, trust signals appearing on screen. More polished than BCH Main, less cinematic than BCH Lux. |
| **Thumbnail** | Dark blue accent, Raleigh branding visible, feature callout OR customer smiling with cycle, clean design. |

### Content Pillars

| # | Pillar | % | What it is | Example |
|---|--------|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Feature Highlights** | 25% | Specific Raleigh features DEMONSTRATED in action. Show, don't tell. | "Petrol sensor: watch what happens when I hit 25km/h" |
| 2 | **Customer Celebrations** | 25% | Birthday deliveries, family purchases, milestone moments. Lean into female + teen demo. | Family buying Raleigh for daughter's birthday — her reaction |
| 3 | **Gift & Offer Promos** | 20% | "Maximum Gifts," seasonal offers, bundle deals. Gift format drives engagement. | "Buy Raleigh this weekend → get Rs. 5,000 worth of accessories FREE" |
| 4 | **Trust Signals** | 15% | 2-year warranty, after-sales service, Raleigh brand credibility, long-term durability | "365 days later — same Raleigh, zero problems" (customer revisit) |
| 5 | **Raleigh vs Others** | 15% | Side-by-side comparisons vs other e-cycle brands. Feature-for-feature. Why Raleigh wins. | Raleigh vs [competitor] — range test on same route |

### Do / Don't

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Feature DEMONSTRATIONS (not just specs) | Spec sheets / number lists |
| Customer stories, especially families | Generic product-only content |
| Gift promos with visual stacking | Vague "sale" posts |
| Warranty/trust emphasis | Ignoring after-sales angle |
| Content for women buyers (38.2% female!) | Assuming only male audience |
| Teen-focused content (13.7% teens!) | Only parent-targeted content |

### How This Is DIFFERENT From Wattson Wheelz
Wattson = ALL e-cycle brands, expert reviews, comparison hub.
Raleigh x BCH = ONLY Raleigh, trust-building, family-focused, celebration moments.

**If it's "which e-cycle should I buy?" → Wattson.**
**If it's "why Raleigh is the one" → Raleigh x BCH.**

### UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY
38.2% female audience (HIGHEST among all BCH profiles) + 13.7% teen audience (also HIGHEST). No other page has this. Create content SPECIFICALLY for:
- Women buying e-cycles (commute safety, ease of use, lifestyle)
- Teens getting their first e-cycle (freedom, cool factor, peer reaction)

### Posting Target
**3-4 reels/week** | Post at **6 PM** | Cross-post to YouTube consistently

---

## PROFILE 8: NEXT.BLR (@next.blr)

### Identity Card

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Color** | Mint/Teal + White (fresh, urban, clean, modern, new beginning) |
| **Tone** | Modern, urban, Bangalore-specific. NOT a cycle shop page. A LIFESTYLE page that features cycles. "Your next step" energy. Fresh, young, city vibes. |
| **Language** | English-Kannada mix. More English-forward than other pages (urban Bangalore audience). Casual, Gen-Z adjacent. |
| **Hook Style** | Dramatic product reveals (Devil Cycle format = 54.7K views). Urban night shots. Cinematic product-as-hero. Dramatic one-liners ("People Crying After Watching This"). |
| **Editing** | Clean cuts, dramatic lighting (night/golden hour), product hero shots against urban backdrops, minimal text, modern transitions. Most "Instagram-native" editing among all pages. |
| **Thumbnail** | Teal accent, product in urban/night setting, dramatic lighting, clean modern design, minimal text. |

### Content Pillars

| # | Pillar | % | What it is | Example |
|---|--------|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Product Hero Showcases** | 35% | Cinematic product reveals in urban Bangalore settings. The product is the STAR. | Devil Cycle at night = 54.7K views (best format) |
| 2 | **Urban Commute Content** | 25% | Bangalore-specific commuting. "My ride to work." Practical city cycling. Relatable daily life. | "Silk Board traffic? Not my problem anymore" |
| 3 | **Lifestyle Integration** | 20% | Cycling + city life. Coffee rides, weekend routes, Bangalore cycling culture. | "Sunday morning coffee run on the AUKI — Koramangala to Indiranagar" |
| 4 | **Dramatic Storytelling** | 10% | Emotional hooks + product. Dramatic titles. Story-driven content. | "People Crying After Watching This Reel" format |
| 5 | **AOK Brand Building** | 10% | What AOK stands for, brand story, why this bike, product education | "AOK — built for Bangalore roads, not European highways" |

### Do / Don't

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Cinematic product shots with dramatic lighting | Bright store-floor footage (that's BCH Main) |
| Urban Bangalore settings (streets, cafes, landmarks) | Studio or store-only content |
| Dramatic titles that create curiosity | Boring descriptive titles |
| Night/golden hour shooting | Flat daylight only |
| Lifestyle-first, product-second | Product-first retail approach |
| Modern, clean visual aesthetic | Cluttered frames, too much text |

### How This Is DIFFERENT From Every Other BCH Page
Every other BCH page is a CYCLE SHOP page. Next.BLR is a LIFESTYLE page.
The cycle appears as part of a lifestyle — not in a store, not as a product listing.

**If the content could exist on a Bangalore lifestyle page → Next.BLR.**
**If the content feels like a cycle shop posting → wrong page.**

### GROWTH STRATEGY
This page has the BEST views-to-followers ratio in the entire BCH ecosystem:
- 734 followers → 628K views → 86.9% non-followers
- The algorithm LOVES this content. It's being pushed to massive non-follower audiences.
- **The ONLY bottleneck is volume.** Currently 14 posts total. Need 15-20 reels/month.

### Posting Target
**4-5 reels/week** (CRITICAL — algorithm is ready, just needs fuel) | Post at **6 PM** | 42.2% Bangalore = most local audience

---

## CROSS-PROFILE RULES

### The Traffic Rules (How Content Gets Assigned)

```
DECISION TREE: Where does this content go?

Is it about the BCH STORE itself (culture, team, hiring, behind-the-scenes)?
→ BCH MAIN

Is it an OFFER or DEAL announcement?
→ BCH MAIN (unless it's Raleigh-specific → Raleigh x BCH, or Toyz-specific → BCH Toyz)

Is it an E-CYCLE review, comparison, or ride?
→ WATTSON WHEELZ

Is it a SECONDHAND / REFURBISHED cycle?
→ BCH 2ND LIFE

Is it a KID'S RIDE-ON, POCKET BIKE, or MINI BIKE?
→ BCH TOYZ

Is it a PREMIUM cycle (Rs. 50K+)?
→ BCH LUX

Is it a DOODLE on a cycle?
→ BCH DOODLE (always, no exceptions)

Is it RALEIGH-specific?
→ RALEIGH x BCH

Is it LIFESTYLE / URBAN / CINEMATIC product content?
→ NEXT.BLR

Is it a CUSTOMER STORY?
→ Depends on the product:
  - E-cycle customer → BCH MAIN (emotional) or WATTSON (informational)
  - Kid's toy customer → BCH TOYZ
  - Secondhand customer → BCH 2ND LIFE
  - Raleigh customer → RALEIGH x BCH
  - Premium customer → BCH LUX
```

### Cross-Posting Rules

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **NEVER** cross-post the same reel to multiple profiles | Each profile = unique content. Same-same problem starts with same content. |
| **CAN** shoot the same event for multiple profiles | A customer buying a Raleigh can generate: 1 reel for BCH Main (celebration), 1 reel for Raleigh (feature focus), 1 reel for Wattson (review angle). SAME shoot, DIFFERENT angles, DIFFERENT edits. |
| **YouTube cross-posting** | Wattson Wheelz → YouTube (reviews, rides). Raleigh x BCH → YouTube (features, comparisons). Others = Instagram-only for now. |

### Universal Posting Schedule

| Day | Priority Profiles (must post) | Secondary (post if content ready) |
|-----|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Monday** | BCH Main, BCH Toyz | Wattson, Next.BLR |
| **Tuesday** | BCH Main, Wattson, BCH Toyz | 2nd Life, Raleigh |
| **Wednesday** | BCH Main, Next.BLR | 2nd Life, Doodle |
| **Thursday** | BCH Main, Wattson, BCH Toyz | Raleigh, Lux |
| **Friday** | BCH Main, Wattson | 2nd Life, Doodle, Lux |
| **Saturday** | BCH Main | Next.BLR, Raleigh |
| **Sunday** | BCH Main | Lighter posting across all |

**ALL posts at 6 PM.** No exceptions.

### Weekly Content Targets

| Profile | Reels/Week | Priority Level |

### The 0.5-Second Test

Before posting ANY reel, ask: **"If I showed this to someone for half a second — no audio, no handle visible — could they tell which BCH page it's from?"**

How to pass:
- **BCH Main** → Orange energy, Kannada text, store + people visible
- **Wattson** → Blue tint, e-cycle close-up, specs on screen
- **2nd Life** → Green, before/after, price comparison
- **BCH Toyz** → Red/yellow, kid reacting, product in action
- **BCH Lux** → Black/gold, cinematic detail shot, premium feel
- **Doodle** → Colorful, art on cycle, creative process
- **Raleigh** → Dark blue, Raleigh branding, feature demo
- **Next.BLR** → Teal/mint, urban setting, dramatic lighting

If it fails this test → wrong page or wrong edit.

## WHAT'S STILL NEEDED

1. **BCH Lux dashboard data** — Need Instagram analytics to validate reboot strategy
2. **BCH Doodle dashboard data** — Need analytics to diagnose decline
3. **Competitive analysis for BCH Toyz** — Study top ride-on/pocket bike creators
4. **Profile-specific concepts** — New concepts written PER profile (not generic)
5. **Visual identity execution** — Color palettes, font choices, thumbnail templates (design execution)
6. **Social media calendar template** — Detailed monthly planner with all 8 profiles
