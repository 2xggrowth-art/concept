### 1. THE CONVOY

**Hook:** 4 Creta doors open simultaneously. 4 people step out in slow motion.

Creta pulls up to BCH. Engine cuts. All 4 doors swing open at the same time. Kid steps out first. 2 males flank him on either side. Female walks behind. Slow-motion walk toward the store entrance. Action movie music. They don't look at the camera. They look straight ahead. Like they're about to rob the place. They walk in. Hard cut to: kid pointing at a Raleigh. "That one." Cut to: Rs. 43,000 on the bill. Cut to: all 4 walking out in the same slow-mo formation. But now the kid is pushing a cycle. 4 people. 1 Creta. 1 kid's cycle. Text: "Overkill? Maybe. But the kid got what he wanted."

### 2. THE LOADING

**Hook:** Creta trunk opens. A cycle is being loaded in from a low angle — looks like they're hiding something.

Tight on the trunk. Low camera angle shooting UP. One male holds the cycle, the other guides it in. They look left. They look right. "Go. Go. Go." Trunk SLAMS shut. One of them SLAPS the side of the Creta twice — the universal "we're clear" signal. The female is already in the car, engine running. The kid is in the backseat, watching through the rear window. Creta pulls away from BCH. Voiceover: "4 suspects. 1 Hyundai Creta. 1 Raleigh cycle. Rs. 43,000 in cash. No one was harmed." Text: "It was a family buying a cycle. Relax."

### 3. THE BODYGUARD

**Hook:** Kid walks through BCH. 2 males scanning every direction like Secret Service agents. One touches his ear.

Kid enters BCH first. The 2 males follow, 2 steps behind, eyes scanning the store left and right. One touches his ear like he's got an earpiece: "VIP is inside. Proceeding to the Raleigh section." The kid walks through the store casually. The males maintain formation. Kid stops at a cycle. Touches it. Male 1 to Male 2: "VIP has made contact with the target." Kid sits on it. Nods. "Target confirmed. Rs. 43,000. Authorize?" Female at the counter, handling payment like the operations handler: "Authorized." Kid rides the cycle toward the exit. Males walking alongside. "VIP extracted. Mission complete."

### 4. THE SURVEILLANCE

**Hook:** Shaky camera. Across the street. Zoomed in on a Creta pulling up to BCH. Timestamp ticking in the corner.

Shot from across the road like undercover surveillance footage. Shaky zoom on the Creta parking. Timestamp: 14:32:07. 4 individuals exit the vehicle. Camera follows them walking toward BCH. One holds the door. They all enter. Time skip — timestamp: 14:51:23. 4 individuals exit. One is now pushing a large object — a cycle. They load it into the vehicle. "Suspects last seen heading north on Yelahanka main road. Vehicle: white Hyundai Creta. Cargo: 1 Raleigh bicycle. Value: Rs. 43,000. Number of suspects: 4. Motive: unknown." Text: "Motive: their kid wanted a cycle."

---

### 5. THE INTERROGATION

**Hook:** Male 1 sitting on a chair outside BCH. Single light on his face. A voice from behind the camera.

Tight on his face. The store light above acting as the harsh interrogation lamp. Voice off-camera, low, slow: "Where were you at 3 PM today?" "BCH, Yelahanka." "And what did you purchase?" "A Raleigh cycle." "For how much?" "43 thousand." "In a Hyundai Creta." "Yes." "With 3 other people." "My family." Long pause. "Sir... 4 people. In a Creta. At a cycle shop. Spending 43 thousand rupees. On a BICYCLE." Pause. "That's suspicious behavior." Male 1, cracking a smile: "It's for my son, sir." Voice: "That's what they ALL say." Cut to the kid riding the cycle in front of the store, grinning. He doesn't care about the interrogation. He got his Raleigh.

---

### 6. THE HANDOFF

**Hook:** Two hands gripping a cycle from opposite sides — staff on one side, customer on the other. Slow-motion handoff.

Extreme close-up: staff member's hands on the Raleigh handlebar. Customer's hands reaching for it. They grip simultaneously. Slow motion. Dramatic music. Like a drug deal where the briefcase slides across the table. Their eyes meet. A nod. The cycle changes hands. The customer walks it toward the Creta. The female holds the trunk open. The kid is already inside, watching. The cycle goes in. A handshake between the staff and the male — tight close-up of the hands, slow motion. "The deal is done." Wide shot: they're just standing outside a cycle store shaking hands. Text: "Rs. 43,000. 1 Raleigh. 4 happy people. 0 crimes committed."

---

### 7. THE RATIO

**Hook:** Static wide shot. Left: a Hyundai Creta. Right: a kid's Raleigh cycle. The size difference is absurd.

No dialogue. No music at first. Just hold the shot. The Creta on one side, the Raleigh on the other. Text appears:

"The car: Rs. 15,00,000."
"The cycle: Rs. 43,000."
"People who came: 4."
"Cycles purchased: 1."
"For: a kid."

Beat.

The kid walks into frame. Ignores the Creta. Gets on the cycle. Rides off. The 3 adults watch him go. Get into the Creta. Follow him at 5 km/h. The Rs. 15 lakh car is now the ESCORT vehicle for a Rs. 43K cycle.

Text: "When your kid gets a cycle, the Creta becomes the support car."

---

### 8. THE PASSENGER

**Hook:** The cycle is strapped into the front seat of the Creta. Seatbelt on. The father is now in the back.

Shot through the Creta's window. The Raleigh cycle is sitting in the front passenger seat. Seatbelt pulled across it. The kid is in the back, grinning. One male is squeezed in the back with the kid and the female. The other male is driving. He looks at the cycle in the passenger seat. Looks at the camera. "She gets shotgun because she's new." The cycle has been promoted to family member status. The Rs. 43K Raleigh has better seating than the humans. Text: "When the newest family member gets the best seat."

---

### 9. THE HUDDLE

**Hook:** All 4 standing in a tight circle outside BCH, heads together, hands in the middle — like a sports team before a play.

Outside BCH, next to the Creta. 4 people huddle up. Tight circle. Heads in. Whispering. It looks like they're planning something. One male: "Everyone knows the plan?" Nods all around. They put their hands in the center. "BCH on 3. 1, 2, 3 — BCH!" They break. Storm the store entrance. Hard cut: 20 minutes later. Same 4 people. Same huddle outside. Same circle. Hands in the middle. "Did we get it?" Kid holds up the Raleigh. "MISSION COMPLETE!" They break. High fives. Load up the Creta. Drive off. Text: "4-person tactical unit. 1 objective. 0 failures."

---

### 10. THE GETAWAY

**Hook:** Creta REVERSES out of the BCH parking fast. Tires. Speed. It looks like a getaway.

Start with the ending. Creta reverses out FAST. Camera shakes. It looks like they're fleeing a scene. Creta speeds off down the road. The cycle is visible through the rear window. Suspenseful music. Text: "5 minutes earlier..." Rewind to: 4 people calmly walking into BCH. The kid trying cycles. The parents paying. Staff handing over the Raleigh. Everyone smiling. Normal transaction. Fast forward back to the "getaway." Same shot of the Creta speeding off. But now you know the truth: it's just a family who finished shopping and wants to get home. The "crime" was buying a cycle. Text: "Not every Creta leaving a store fast is a getaway. Sometimes the kid just can't wait to ride."
