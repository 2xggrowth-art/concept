# 10 WALK-IN SCRIPTS — BCH

> All store + footpath. All staff + real customers. All shootable in under 30 min. All crime-genre mismatch on innocent cycle-store activity. Physical action first, dialogue minimal.

### 1. THE CHALK OUTLINE

First frame: chalk outline on the footpath outside BCH. Not a body — the outline is shaped like a CYCLE. Crime scene tape around it. Staff standing over it, arms crossed, shaking his head slowly.

A passerby stops. "What happened here?"

Staff, dead serious: "A sale."

Pause.

"Someone just bought the last Doodle."

Camera pans to the empty spot inside the store where the cycle was. One staff member is sweeping the area like cleaning up a crime scene. Another is taking photos of the empty rack "for evidence."

Text: "Doodle. Gone. Another one taken from us."

End card: BCH Yelahanka. More in stock. For now.

### 2. THE BODY BAG

Two staff members wrapping a cycle in bubble wrap. Tight. Methodical. Head to toe. Low angle looking up at them — it looks like they're wrapping a body. One holds, the other wraps. They don't speak. Just nods.

They lift it HORIZONTALLY. Carry it through the store door. Slow. Careful. A customer holds the car trunk open. They slide it in. Gently.

Staff pulls out an envelope. Hands it to the customer. "Everything's in here." It's the receipt.

Handshake. Customer drives off.

Staff watches the car leave. Turns to camera: "Clean delivery. No witnesses."

Text: "It's a cycle. We just take packaging seriously."

### 3. THE STAKEOUT

Two staff sitting on plastic chairs outside BCH. One has chai. One has biscuit. They're not talking. They're just WATCHING the road. Eyes scanning. Calm. Patient.

A man appears in the distance. Walking toward the store. Kid holding his hand.

Staff 1 (without turning his head): "Target approaching. Male. Mid-30s. Kid in tow."

Staff 2 sips chai: "Copy. What's the kid wearing?"

Staff 1: "Helmet. He's wearing a helmet already."

Both put down their chai simultaneously. Stand up in sync. Walk inside. Positions taken.

The man and kid walk in. They have NO idea what just happened.

Text: "BCH sales team doesn't wait. BCH sales team HUNTS."

---

### 4. THE DRUG TEST

Staff pulls the battery out of an e-cycle. Holds it up to the store light. Tilts it. Examines the bottom. Taps it twice with his knuckle. Listens.

He places it on a weighing scale. Reads the number. Writes it down in a small notebook.

Holds it under the light again. Nods slowly. "Pure. 48 volt. Lithium. Full charge."

Hands it to the customer like he's handing over contraband. Customer takes it with both hands.

Staff: "Handle with care. This runs 60 kilometres."

Text: "It's a battery check. But the cinematography chose violence."

---

### 5. THE SURRENDER

A kid walks into BCH with his hands UP. Arms straight in the air. His father is behind him, one hand on the kid's shoulder, pushing him forward like a prisoner being escorted into court.

Father to staff: "6 hours. Phone. Non-stop. I'm surrendering him."

Staff looks at the kid. Looks at the father. Nods.

Staff picks up a helmet from the counter. Places it on the kid's head slowly. Like a sentencing.

"We have a rehabilitation program, sir."

Walks the kid to the test ride area. Kid gets on an e-cycle. Starts riding. His face goes from "prisoner" to grinning in 3 seconds flat.

Father watching. Arms crossed. First smile.

Staff: "Most recover within one test ride."

---

### 6. THE DROP

Outside BCH. Footpath. Two guys face each other. One is staff. One is customer.

No words.

Customer reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a cash bundle. Slides it across the counter through the window.

Staff reaches behind him. Rolls a cycle forward. Pushes it through the door.

They make eye contact. One nod. That's it.

Customer takes the cycle. Walks one direction. Staff walks back inside the other direction. Neither looks back.

Dramatic music cuts. Record scratch.

Text: "Just a normal purchase at BCH. But we watched too many movies."

---

### 7. THE PERP WALK

A kid pushes a brand new cycle out the BCH front door. On either side of him: one staff member each. Walking slow. Serious faces. Looking straight ahead. The kid is in the middle, hands on the handlebars, flanked like a criminal being walked to the van.

Other customers inside the store are watching through the glass.

One customer to another: "What did he do?"

"He bought the Doodle."

Silence. Respect.

The kid loads his cycle. The staff watch him leave. One of them crosses his arms. "Another one gone."

Text: "Some kids leave BCH with a cycle. Some leave as legends."

---

### 8. THE AUTOPSY

Staff member bent over a cycle. Latex gloves on (if available, or just act like it). Tools laid out on a cloth beside him — wrench, pump, Allen keys — like surgical instruments.

He leans in close. Examines the chain. Runs his finger along it. "Chain — clean."

Checks the brakes. Squeezes. "Brakes — responsive."

Spins the wheel. Watches it rotate. "Rotation — smooth."

Taps the frame. Listens. "No fractures."

Stands up. Removes gloves. Looks at the customer.

"She's healthy. Ready to ride."

Customer, who's been watching this entire performance: "Bro... I just asked for a test ride."

Text: "BCH doesn't sell cycles. BCH releases them into the wild after a full medical."

---

### 9. THE HANDCUFF

Customer just bought a cycle. It's parked outside BCH. Staff kneels down beside it.

Pulls out a heavy-duty chain lock. Thick. The chain CLINKS as he uncoils it. He wraps it slowly around the cycle frame and the parking rack. Loop by loop.

CLICK. Locked.

He stands up. Dusts his knees. Holds up the key between two fingers.

Hands it to the customer.

"She's secured. Nobody's taking her."

The way he wraps the chain, the deliberate loops, the click — it looks exactly like someone being handcuffed to a railing.

Customer takes the key: "It's a cycle lock, bro."

Staff, walking away: "It's PROTECTION."

---

### 10. THE CONFESSION BOOTH

A kid sits in the BCH seating area. Small chair. Legs dangling. Head down.

Staff member sits across from him. Slides a cycle catalog across the table like a case file.

Opens it. Points to a page.

"You recognize this?"

Kid looks. Nods slowly.

"How long?"

Kid, quiet: "6 months."

"6 months you've wanted this and you didn't tell your father?"

Kid shakes his head.

The father. He's been standing behind the shelf the whole time. He heard everything. He walks up. Puts his hand on the kid's shoulder.

Looks at the staff member. One nod.

Staff picks up the phone: "We'll get it ready."

The kid looks up at his father. That face — that's the content.

Text: "Every weekend, someone confesses at BCH. And every time, the father was already listening."

*10 scripts. All at the store. All crime-genre mismatch. All physical-first. The store IS the set. The staff ARE the actors. The customers ARE the story. Shoot them when the moment is right — when a kid walks in with a parent, when a purchase happens, when the footpath is empty enough for chalk.*
