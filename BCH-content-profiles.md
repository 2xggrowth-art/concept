- E-cycle use cases, commute stories
- New e-cycle launches, technology updates
- Brand comparisons
- Ride content, range tests

**Future Vision:** Convert into an "electric influencer" page — travel + e-cycle, food + e-cycle, calorie burn + e-cycle.

**Working:** 98.5% reels, 78% non-follower reach (viral), customer showcases (11L!), link taps +131%

| Top City | Bangalore 38.4%, Mysore 2.7%, **Chennai 2.2%** (unique to this profile!) |
| Peak Time | **6 PM** |

### What Goes Here
Strictly secondhand bicycles.
- Available stock updates
- Why buy secondhand cycles
- How to buy secondhand cycles
- Current collection showcases
- Exchange/buyback program awareness
- Budget cycling content

**The Conversion Funnel (KEY INSIGHT):**
People follow for budget options → Visit store for secondhand → See the new collection → **~50% upgrade to brand new bicycles**. This page is TOP-OF-FUNNEL for new cycle sales.

**TG Segments:**
- Guy wanting a gear cycle at Rs. 5,000
- Guy wanting a premium road/MTB/hybrid used
- Guy wanting an affordable e-cycle (Rs. 10-15K, slightly used)

**Current Challenge:** Stock flushed — sold 109 old bicycles in bulk to Kerala buyers. Not aggressively promoting until stock rebuilds.

### What's Working / What Needs Attention
**Working:** Sustainability angle (unique), highest story usage (8.3%), engagement quality good despite reach decline, Chennai audience (unique)
**CRITICAL:** Reach COLLAPSED -46.9% (worst among all profiles). Non-follower reach only 46.4% (others are 75-89%). Algorithm isn't pushing content. Needs URGENT intervention.

### Audience
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Top City | Bangalore 38.1%, Mysore 3.2% |
| Peak Time | **6-9 PM** |
| Best Days | **Monday, Tuesday, Thursday** |

### What Goes Here
- Kids ride-on showcases, demos
- Pocket bike content (Orion Super Dirt Bike)
- Adult mini bike content
- Kids reaction content
- Product comparisons
- Offer announcements

**Potential:** HUGE — kids + exciting products = viral formula. 89.6% non-follower reach proves the algorithm loves this content.

**Future Consideration:** Separate profile JUST for pocket bikes — but needs 30+ pieces of content first.

### Key Concept Series Assigned
- Pocket Bike series (PB1-PB50) — Zubair & Sami
- Ray-Ban Meta POV series (RM1-RM20)
- Mass Series (MS1-MS33)

### What's Working / What Needs Attention
**Working:** 89.6% non-follower reach (BEST!), petrol bike content (1.3M!), offer-based content drives follows, recovering from 90-day dip
**Needs attention:** Story usage low (2.2%), missing Wed/Fri/weekend posting, link click rate (8.9% CTR from profile visits)

## PROFILE 5: BCH LUX (PREMIUM)

**Handle:** TBD
**Platform:** Instagram (~600-700 followers)
**Products:** Premium bicycles Rs. 50K–2.5L (e.g., Polygon Stratos S7 — full carbon, Rs. 2.5L)

> **NO INSTAGRAM DATA FILE PROVIDED** — analysis pending. Need dashboard screenshots.

### What Goes Here
- Premium bicycle showcases
- High-end specs, carbon frames, premium groupsets
- Lifestyle + premium cycling content
- Cycling enthusiast content
- Premium bike comparisons

### Why It Failed
1. Stuck to English language — killed reach
2. Weak hooks
3. Weak storytelling
4. Content felt like international creator copies without local flavor
5. Only 2-3K views per video

### Current Opportunity
Owner wants to LIQUIDATE entire premium stock. Perfect trigger for a content push.

### Reboot Strategy Needed
- Language: Switch to local language / mix
- Hooks: Apply all visual hook learnings from BCH main
- Storytelling: Make it feel organic, not aspirational-corporate
- Liquidation series: Could drive massive conversion if done right

**Inspiration Source:** International premium bicycle creators (content was easy to replicate, doable)

## PROFILE 6: BCH DOODLE

**Handle:** TBD
**Platform:** Instagram (~85K followers, ~120-130 posts)

> **NO INSTAGRAM DATA FILE PROVIDED** — analysis pending. Need dashboard screenshots.

### What Goes Here
ONLY doodle content. Nothing else.

### History
This page was a MASTERSTROKE. Blew up when doodle content went viral. Every single piece of content posted was viral. Proof of concept that "content is king, storytelling is the way."

### Current Issue
Average reach dropped drastically. Was viral → now ~20-30K views average.

### What Made It Work Originally
- Doodle as a product was HOT/trending
- Content was consistent
- Every video went viral organically

### Why It's Declining
TBD — needs diagnosis (algorithm shift? content fatigue? posting inconsistency?)

| Peak Time | **6 PM** |

### What Goes Here
- Raleigh product showcases
- Why Raleigh, what makes it different
- Raleigh use cases, customer stories
- Raleigh comparisons vs other e-cycle brands

**Challenge:** Cross-posting to YouTube not happening consistently. Needs a posting manager.

### What's Working / What Needs Attention
**Working:** 88.9% non-follower reach (excellent viral), highest female audience (38.2%), highest teen audience (13.7%), gift/warranty content works
**Needs attention:** Reach declining -12%, story usage low (1.3%), posting frequency could increase

**Handle:** @next.blr
**Platform:** Instagram (734 followers)
**Posts:** 14
**Following:** 1
**Bio:** "everyday life, just before the next step — kids, movement — EV made simple for daily life"

| Accounts Reached | 402,273 (0% change) |
| Interactions | 23,300 (UP) |
| New Followers | +535 |

### Top Performing Content
1. Devil Cycle (orange bike at night) — **54.7K views**
2. AUKI - Power, Style, Comfort — **43.5K views**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gender | 66.0% Male / 34.0% Female |
| Top Age | 35-44 (34.0%), 25-34 (28.7%) — 62.7% are 25-44 |
| Top City | **Bangalore 42.2%** (HIGHEST BLR concentration among all!) |
| Peak Time | **6 PM** |

### What Goes Here
AOK cycles. Attempted outdoor/adventure angle.

**Current Issue:** Getting diluted — no content strategy, no social media calendar, no strong pillars.

**Potential:** Only 734 followers but 628K views and 86.9% non-follower reach — the ALGORITHM LOVES this content. Views-to-followers ratio is BY FAR the best across all profiles. This page has the raw viral engine; it just needs direction and volume.

### What's Working / What Needs Attention
**Working:** 86.9% non-follower reach, product showcases + dramatic titles work, 42.2% Bangalore audience (most local)
**Needs attention:** Only 14 posts total, zero stories, needs 3-4x posting frequency, needs clear content identity

---

## CROSS-PROFILE INTELLIGENCE

### Universal Patterns (Confirmed Across All 6 Analyzed Profiles)

**1. Peak Posting Time: 6 PM — UNIVERSAL**
Every single BCH profile peaks at 6 PM. No exceptions.

**2. Reels Domination: 91-100%**
All profiles are 91%+ reels. This is the format. Don't fight it.

**3. Audience: Parents 25-44 are 63-77% of every profile**
The BCH buyer is NOT the rider. It's the PARENT buying for the rider. Content must speak to parents.

**4. Bangalore: 38-42% of all audiences**
Every profile is ~40% Bangalore. This is a LOCAL business with local customers.

**5. Male-Dominant: 62-74% across all profiles**
But Raleigh has the highest female audience (38.2%) — opportunity to study why.

### Best Days to Post (from profiles with day data)
| Profile | Best Days |
|---------|-----------|
| Wattson Wheelz | **Tuesday, Thursday, Friday** |
| BCH Toyz | **Monday, Tuesday, Thursday** |
| Others | No day data — use Tue/Thu as baseline |

### Non-Follower Reach Rankings (Viral Potential)
1. **BCH Toyz** — 89.6% (BEST viral reach)
2. **Raleigh x BCH** — 88.9%
3. **Next.BLR** — 86.9%
4. **Wattson Wheelz** — 77.6%
5. **BCH Main** — 63.8%
6. **BCH 2nd Life** — 46.4% (WORST — algorithm not pushing)

### Health Status
| Profile | Status | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| BCH Main | THRIVING (+152.8% reach) | Maintain momentum |
| Wattson Wheelz | MIXED (reach +97.6% but views -50%) | Increase posting frequency |
| BCH Toyz | RECOVERING (reversing 90-day decline) | Keep pushing, ride momentum |
| Raleigh x BCH | GROWING (engagement up, reach dipping) | Increase volume |
| Next.BLR | DORMANT BUT HIGH-POTENTIAL (734 followers, 628K views) | Needs strategy + volume |
| BCH 2nd Life | CRITICAL (-46.9% reach) | Urgent intervention |
| BCH Lux | FAILED (~600 followers) | Full reboot needed |
| BCH Doodle | DECLINING (was viral, now 20-30K avg) | Diagnosis needed |

---

## CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES (applies to ALL pages)

### 1. Same-Same Problem
> "One thing you'll find very common among all these pages is that the content feels very same. The style of editing is same. The content also feels same."

Every page needs its OWN:
- Visual identity / branding elements
- Editing style
- Content tone
- Hook style
- Color palette / thumbnails

### 2. No Social Media Calendar
No structured posting schedule across any page. Consistency is the #1 challenge. Without a calendar, content is reactive, not strategic.

### 3. Posting Manager Gap
No dedicated person handling posting + cross-posting. Expected to be in place by Monday/Tuesday next week.

### 4. Team
- **2 in-house editors** — currently work from home, moving to hybrid (2 days in office) from next week
- **Anil** — lead videographer + 1 assistant
- **Posting manager** — hiring, expected by Monday/Tuesday

### 5. Cross-Posting
YouTube presence exists for Watts on Wheels and Raleigh x BCH but not consistently maintained. Need systematic cross-posting.

---

## MISSING DATA

The following profiles do NOT have Instagram dashboard analysis files:

1. **BCH Lux** — Need dashboard screenshots to build reboot strategy with data
2. **BCH Doodle** — Need dashboard screenshots to diagnose decline

Without this data, content pillars and strategy for these 2 profiles will be based on qualitative observations only.

---

## ACTION ITEMS

- [ ] Define content pillars for each profile (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Create visual identity guidelines per profile
- [ ] Build social media calendar template
- [ ] Study competition for Toys/Kids ride-on space
- [ ] Reboot strategy for BCH Lux
- [ ] Diagnose Doodle page decline
- [ ] Set up cross-posting workflow
- [ ] Assign existing concept series to correct profiles
- [ ] Create new concepts PER PROFILE (not generic)
- [ ] Get BCH Lux dashboard data
- [ ] Get BCH Doodle dashboard data
