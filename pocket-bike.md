# 100 POCKET BIKE CONCEPTS — ZUBAIR & SAMI SERIES (PB1–PB100)

**Product:** Orion Super Dirt Bike — 50CC Pocket Petrol Bike
**Brand:** Bharath Cycle Hub (BCH), Bangalore
**Cast:** Zubair (main), Sami (supporting)
**Specs:** 50CC 2-stroke, air-cooled, pull start + electric start, all disc brakes, inverted forks, adjustable shocks, alloy exhaust, 1.5L tank, 35 KMPL, 23kg weight, 45km/h top speed, 90kg load capacity, 62cm seat height, 18cm ground clearance, automatic transmission, chain drive, 12V battery, emergency stop.

**The comedy:** It's TINY but looks AGGRESSIVE. Adults ride it and look ridiculous. It sounds like a monster but fits under a bed. 23kg means you can literally CARRY it. The genre mismatch between "serious dirt bike energy" and "it's the size of a suitcase" does all the work.

---

## PB1 — THE KGF ENTRY

Zubair does the full Rocky Bhai slow-motion entry — leather jacket, sunglasses, dramatic KGF BGM, dust in the air. Camera reveals from the bottom up: boots, legs, hands on the handlebar... and it's a pocket bike. His knees are near his chest. Sami standing there with a regular bike, jaw on the floor. Zubair, dead serious: "It's not about the size, Sami. It's about the entry."

---

## PB2 — THE PETROL BUNK

Zubair pulls into a petrol bunk. Full confidence. "Full tank." Attendant starts filling. Meter barely moves. Stops at Rs. 150. Attendant: "Bro... this is FULL?" Zubair: "1.5 litres. That's the whole tank." Attendant looks at the nozzle, looks at the bike, looks at Zubair. Calls his colleague: "Come see this." Sami filming from behind, dying.

---

## PB3 — THE VALET

Zubair pulls up to a fancy hotel on the pocket bike. Hands the key to the valet like he's dropping off a Benz. "Careful with her." Valet stares down at this tiny thing. "Sir, I can just—" picks up the ENTIRE BIKE with one hand and moves it to the side. Zubair, offended: "Bro. You can't just CARRY someone's vehicle." Sami at the entrance, face in hands.

---

## PB4 — THE TRAFFIC FILTER

Bangalore traffic. Dead standstill. Two Fortuners side by side, zero gap. Zubair on the pocket bike slots through a space that shouldn't exist. Both SUV drivers look down from their windows. WAY down. Zubair looks up, sunglasses on, doesn't acknowledge them. Rides through. Sami on the footpath: "He just filtered through a gap that a DOG wouldn't fit through."

---

## PB5 — THE PULL START

Zubair in the parking lot. Grabs the pull-start cord. Pulls. Nothing. Pulls harder. Nothing. Sami: "Is this a bike or a lawnmower?" Zubair pulls one more time with EVERYTHING he's got — the 2-stroke SCREAMS to life. Raw, angry, loud. Every single person in the parking lot turns around expecting a superbike. It's this tiny thing vibrating with fury. Zubair: "50cc of pure anger, Sami."

---

## PB6 — THE MECHANIC

Zubair rolls the pocket bike into a local mechanic's shop. "Bhai, it's not turning on." The mechanic looks at the tiny bike, confused for a second, then just pulls the kick starter — it fires up instantly. Zubair: "Oh... thanks bhai." Hops on and rides away. The mechanic watches this grown man leave on a miniature bike. Natural reaction moment — he might laugh, shake his head, or say something like "Kya scene hai yeh" to the camera. Real mechanic, real reaction, zero script needed.

---

## PB7 — THE PARKED NEXT TO A BULLET

Zubair parks the pocket bike next to a Royal Enfield Bullet. Side by side. The pocket bike reaches the Bullet's WHEEL hub. Sami places objects for scale: a water bottle (same height as the seat), a school bag (bigger than the bike), a dog that walks past (same height). Zubair sitting on it, knees at his chest: "Same disc brakes though."

---

## PB8 — THE SOUND REVEAL

Pitch black screen. Just audio. A VIOLENT 2-stroke engine revving. Sounds like a dirt bike racing event. Getting louder. Angrier. You're picturing a 450cc motocross machine. Lights slowly come up. It's the pocket bike. Shaking with rage. Barely 2 feet tall. Zubair on it looking like he's riding a toy. Sami: "23 kilos and makes more noise than your entire personality."

---

## PB9 — THE COP

Zubair riding the pocket bike. Cop waves him down. "License?" Zubair: "Sir, 50cc. No license required." Cop walks around the bike. Takes 2 seconds — it's that small. Squats down to find the engine. "Where is it?" Zubair points. Cop inspects. Stands up. Takes off his cap. "How much?" Sami from behind: "Sir, BCH. Bharath Cycle Hub."

---

## PB10 — THE RACE

Zubair on the pocket bike. Sami on a regular bicycle. Traffic signal. Both lock eyes. Light goes green. Zubair LAUNCHES — the 2-stroke screaming. Sami pedaling with everything he has. 10 seconds later, Zubair is 3 blocks ahead. Sami arrives 2 minutes later, drenched in sweat. Zubair hasn't broken a sweat. "45km/h, Sami. Petrol beats pedal."

---

## PB11 — THE CARRY

Dead Bangalore traffic. Nobody moving. Zubair gets off the pocket bike. Picks up the ENTIRE BIKE with one hand (23kg). Puts it on his shoulder. Walks past every car, every auto, every bus. Reaches the other side of the jam. Puts the bike down. Gets on. Rides away. Every driver watched the whole thing. Sami, stuck in the traffic: "BRO COME BACK FOR ME!"

---

## PB12 — THE MINI MOTOGP

Zubair in full racing gear — helmet, gloves, knee guards, racing suit. Gets on the pocket bike. He looks like a MotoGP racer except the bike is the size of a suitcase. Hits the dirt. Leans into corners. Tiny rooster tail of dust. Sami commentating: "AND ZUBAIR TAKES THE CORNER AT FULL LEAN! 50CC OF PURE AGGRESSION! THE CROWD GOES WILD!" The "crowd" is 3 stray dogs and a chai guy.

---

## PB13 — THE FIRST DATE

Zubair shows up to pick someone up. Fully groomed. Cologne. New shirt. "Get on." They look down. Way down. "On... THAT?" Zubair: "50cc petrol engine. Disc brakes. Inverted forks. Top speed 45. You'll never feel more alive." They both squeeze on. Knees up. Helmets touching. Riding at 30km/h through Bangalore. Sami following on foot, somehow keeping up: "I'm the third wheel. Literally."

---

## PB14 — THE SHOWROOM FLEX

Zubair walks into a premium bike showroom. Hayabusa on display. He looks around, completely unimpressed. Salesman: "Sir, interested in something?" Zubair shows the pocket bike photo on his phone. "Already have something better." Salesman leans in. Zooms in. "Where did you get this?" Zubair: "BCH. And no, it doesn't need a loan." Sami outside holding the pocket bike, posing.

---

## PB15 — THE BODYGUARD

The pocket bike is being escorted. Zubair on one side, Sami on the other. Both in black sunglasses. Walking slowly. Hands clasped. The bike rolls between them on a red carpet (it's a red bedsheet). People staring. They stop. Zubair takes a cloth, wipes the seat. Sami adjusts the mirror. They continue. The bike is the celebrity. They are security.

---

## PB16 — THE IMPOSSIBLE PARKING

Giant mall parking lot. FULL. Every spot taken. Zubair spots a 2-foot gap between two SUVs that isn't even a parking space. Slides the pocket bike right in. Perfect fit. Gets off. Takes out a chain lock that's bigger than the bike. Wraps it three times. Sami: "Bro, someone could just pick up the bike AND the chain." Zubair: "That's why you're standing guard." Walks into the mall.

---

## PB17 — THE BANK LOAN

Zubair at a bank. "Vehicle loan, please." Banker: "Make and model?" Zubair: "50cc Super Dirt Bike." Banker types. Frowns. "Not in our system, sir." Zubair: "It has disc brakes on both wheels, inverted forks, adjustable shock absorbers—" Banker: "Sir, you're describing a KTM Duke." Zubair: "Better. It weighs 23 kilos and I can carry it in an elevator." Banker: "...Can I see this bike?" Sami outside: "ANOTHER ONE CONVERTED."

---

## PB18 — THE ACCESSORIES

Zubair in the garage. "Today we accessorize the beast." Adds a phone mount — it's bigger than the headlight. Adds a horn — louder than the engine. Adds LED strips — the bike now glows like a spaceship. Adds a tank pad on the 1.5L tank. Steps back. Sami: "Bro. The accessories cost more than the bike." Zubair: "You don't put a price on DRIP."

---

## PB19 — THE GROUP RIDE

Sunday morning. A line of Royal Enfields, one Harley, two KTMs — and Zubair on the pocket bike. Group leader does a headcount. Double-takes at Zubair. "Bro... THAT'S your ride?" Zubair: "That's my ride." They all roll out. Zubair is a DOT between the big bikes. But at the first traffic signal, Zubair filters through ALL of them to the front. Sami on the back of someone's Enfield: "HE'S LEADING THE PACK AND HIS BIKE FITS IN THEIR SADDLEBAG!"

---

## PB20 — THE WHEELIE

HOOK: Appi or Sanjay hops on the pocket bike, yanks the handlebar back trying a wheelie — bike barely moves, they lose balance, one foot slams the ground, bike tips sideways. Total fail. They're sitting on the ground next to this tiny bike looking defeated. Zubair walks into frame, picks the bike up with ONE HAND (it's 23kg), sets it down, hops on, and just casually rides off. No wheelie. Just smooth. Sami to camera: "See that? 23 kilos. Even when this idiot dropped it — NOTHING broke." Now Zubair rides slow past camera while Sami walks alongside listing off: disc brakes on both wheels, adjustable rear suspension, inverted front forks, alloy exhaust, 50cc engine that does 45km/h, 1.5 litre tank that lasts a whole week. Each feature shown in a quick cut. Zubair pulls up at the end: "Rs. 150 full tank. 7 days of riding." Appi/Sanjay still sitting on the ground in the back: "Bro at least teach me how to ride it first."

---

## PB21 — THE NIGHT RIDE

2 AM. Empty Bangalore road. Street lights. The 2-stroke echoing through empty streets. Camera low — at this angle, the pocket bike looks MASSIVE. Headlight cutting through the dark. Zubair riding slow. Cinematic. Everything looks like a movie. Until a speed breaker hits and both Zubair and the bike bounce a foot in the air. He lands, keeps riding. "ADJUSTABLE SHOCKS, SAMI. WORTH IT."

---

## PB22 — THE DELIVERY BOY

Zubair with a Swiggy bag on the pocket bike. Arrives at the door. Customer opens. Looks down. Way down. "You delivered... on THAT?" Zubair: "Fastest delivery in Bangalore. Zero traffic problems. I fit through every gap. 45km/h." Customer: "But the food is cold." Zubair: "But I was FAST." Sami waiting on the road: "Bro, just give him the food and let's GO."

---

## PB23 — THE INSURANCE CALL

Zubair on the phone: "I'd like to insure my vehicle." Agent: "Make and model?" Zubair: "50cc Super Dirt Bike." Agent: "CC?" Zubair: "50." Long silence. "Sir, our minimum is 100cc." Zubair: "But it has disc brakes on BOTH wheels. Inverted forks. Alloy exhaust. It goes 45—" Agent: "Sir, does it fit in a suitcase?" Zubair: "...almost." Click. Sami: "Told you they wouldn't understand."

---

## PB24 — THE 7-DAY TANK

Zubair fills the 1.5L tank. Rs. 150. Monday, he rides. Tuesday, rides. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday. Sunday — pulls into the same bunk. Same attendant. "Back already?" Zubair: "It's been 7 DAYS." Attendant: "On... 1.5 litres?" Calls his colleagues: "BRO, COME SEE THIS." Four attendants crowded around the pocket bike. Sami narrating: "Rs. 150 per week. My auto to work costs more PER DAY."

---

## PB25 — THE ELEVATOR RIDE

Zubair wheels the pocket bike into his apartment elevator. It fits. With space for 3 more people. Residents get in, stare at the bike, stare at Zubair. He presses 5. Awkward silence. Doors open. Zubair RIDES the bike down the corridor. Into his apartment. Sami holding the door open: "Just park it outside like a normal—" Zubair: "She sleeps INSIDE."

---

## PB26 — THE BIKE WASH

Zubair at a professional bike wash. The workers wash Bullets and Pulsars all day. They see the pocket bike. Dead stare. "Bro... full service?" Zubair: "Full service. Foam wash." They foam it up. One guy picks up the entire bike with one hand while the other sprays underneath. Total wash time: 90 seconds. The fastest wash they've ever done. Zubair pays full price. Sami: "You paid Rs. 200 to wash something smaller than a suitcase."

---

## PB27 — THE ROAD TRIP

Zubair packing like he's crossing the country. Bag. Map. Snacks. Sunglasses. Sami: "Where are you going?" Zubair: "Road trip. Bangalore to Whitefield." Sami: "That's 20 km." Zubair: "On THIS bike, that's an EXPEDITION." Montage: Zubair weaving through traffic, hitting a pothole, jumping a speed breaker, stopping for chai. Arrives at Whitefield. Plants a tiny flag on the handle. "WE MADE IT. 1.5 litres. Zero stops."

---

## PB28 — THE FULL GEAR

Zubair puts on a full-face racing helmet. Visor down. Racing gloves. Knee guards. Armored jacket. Riding boots. He looks like he's about to race at Buddh Circuit. Gets on the pocket bike. His GEAR weighs more than the bike. Sami: "Bro, your helmet alone is 2 kilos. The bike is 23." Zubair: "Safety first, Sami. Safety first." Rides off at 30km/h looking like Valentino Rossi on a toy.

---

## PB29 — THE LOCK

Zubair parks the pocket bike outside a shop. Takes out a MASSIVE industrial chain. Wraps it around the bike. The chain is thicker than the bike frame. Adds a padlock the size of his fist. Steps back. The lock setup weighs more than the bike. Sami: "Anyone can just pick up the bike WITH the chain and leave." Pause. Zubair: "... SAMI, YOU STAND HERE AND GUARD IT."

---

## PB30 — THE BIG GUY TEST RIDE

A big, tall guy at BCH. "I want to try." Gets on the pocket bike. He's 6 feet. His knees are ABOVE the handlebars. Elbows out. He looks like a circus bear on a tricycle. Starts riding. 10 metres. Comes back. Gets off. Everyone expects him to laugh. Instead: "I'll take one." Dead serious. Nobody argues with that face. Sami to camera: "Every. Single. Person. Same reaction."

---

## PB31 — THE SPEEDOMETER

Phone mounted on the handlebars. Speed app running. Zubair goes full throttle on an empty road. The number climbs: 20... 30... 40... 45km/h. At 62cm seat height, 45 feels like 150. The ground is RIGHT THERE. Wind is LOUD. Zubair's eyes are wide. Comes back. Hands shaking. Sami: "You look like you just survived something." Zubair: "I DID. 45km/h has never felt so FAST."

---

## PB32 — THE SPEC COMPARISON

Zubair with a whiteboard. Two columns. LEFT: "Rs. 2 Lakh Bike." RIGHT: "Pocket Bike." Disc brakes? Both. Inverted forks? Both. Can you carry it in an elevator? Only pocket bike. Can you park it in 2 feet? Only pocket bike. Does it fit in a car boot? Only pocket bike. Rs. 150 fills the whole tank? Only pocket bike. Zubair taps the board: "And one of these costs 10 TIMES more." Sami: "He's got a point."

---

## PB33 — THE BUS STOP REVEAL

Zubair sitting at a bus stop. Bus comes. He waves it off. Another bus. Waves it off. Sami: "What are you doing? Get on!" Zubair: "I'm not waiting for a bus." Reaches behind the bench — pulls out the pocket bike. It was HIDDEN behind the seat (it's that small). Pull-starts it. Rides off. Everyone at the bus stop just watched a man reveal a MOTORCYCLE from behind a bench.

---

## PB34 — THE CAR BOOT

Zubair opens the boot of a sedan. It's a normal car. Puts the pocket bike INSIDE the boot. Closes it. Drives the car to a destination. Opens boot. Takes out the bike. Rides the last 2 km. Sami standing there: "You just carried a BACKUP VEHICLE in your car." Zubair: "First mile — car. Last mile — pocket bike. Problem solved."

---

## PB35 — THE BEFORE/AFTER

BEFORE: Zubair in an auto. Stuck in traffic. Meter running. Sweating. Late. AFTER: Zubair on the pocket bike. Weaving through gaps. On time. Rs. 5 of fuel. BEFORE: Walking to the store. 30 minutes. AFTER: Pocket bike. 4 minutes. BEFORE: Borrowing Sami's bike. AFTER: Own pocket bike, fits in the house, costs less than a month of auto rides. Sami: "I want my bike back." Zubair: "Don't need it anymore."

---

## PB36 — THE UNBOXING

Darkened room. Spotlight. Zubair in a black turtleneck. A cardboard box sits center frame. 1100 x 270 x 560mm. He opens it slowly. Pulls out each component like it's a jewel — the frame, the forks, the wheels, the engine. Assembles on camera with dramatic music. Final piece clicks. He hits the start button. Engine ROARS. Sami throws confetti. "IT'S ALIVE. 50CC OF FURY. FROM A BOX."

---

## PB37 — THE ONE-HAND LIFT

Bike meetup. Everyone comparing. KTM guy revving. Bullet guy polishing. Pulsar guy talking specs. Zubair rolls in on the pocket bike. Silence. Then he just... picks up his ENTIRE BIKE with one hand. Holds it overhead. Looks at KTM guy: "Can you do that?" Looks at Bullet guy: "You?" Looks at Pulsar guy: "Anyone?" Nobody moves. Zubair puts the bike down. Gets on. Rides away. Argument won.

---

## PB38 — THE GYM

Sami mocking Zubair at the gym: "You can't even bench 50." Zubair: "I don't need to. I bench my BIKE." Goes to the parking lot. Picks up the pocket bike. Does 5 bicep curls. 23kg per arm. Puts it down. "My bike is my dumbbell. And after the workout, it takes me HOME." Does a few squats holding the bike. Sami: "That's actually... kind of impressive." Zubair: "It's DEFINITELY impressive."

---

## PB39 — THE BEDROOM PARKING

Zubair's mother: "Where's your bike?" Zubair: "Safe." Mother: "WHERE?" Zubair opens his bedroom door. The pocket bike is parked NEXT TO HIS BED. Like a sleeping pet. Mother: "YOU CANNOT KEEP A PETROL BIKE IN YOUR ROOM." Zubair: "It's only 23 kilos, Ammi. And it fits perfectly between the bed and the wall." Sami on video call, wheezing. Zubair strokes the handlebar: "Good night, baby."

---

## PB40 — THE WEIGH-IN

Zubair with a bathroom scale. Places the pocket bike on it: 23kg. Places Sami's college backpack: 18kg. Places a full water can: 20kg. The bike weighs BARELY more than daily household objects. Zubair: "My bike weighs less than a big suitcase. But it goes 45km/h. Name one suitcase that does that." Sami: "Name one bike that fits in a suitcase." Both pause. Both look at the pocket bike. It might actually fit.

---

## PB41 — THE SOUND PRANK

Zubair records the pocket bike's exhaust note — raw, angry 2-stroke scream. Takes the recording to a bike café. Plays it on a Bluetooth speaker. Everyone turns: "WHAT is that? That's nasty!" "Is that a two-stroke racing bike?" People searching for the source. Zubair stops the audio. Holds up his phone: "It's a 50cc pocket bike." Nobody believes it. He goes to the parking lot. Starts the bike. SAME SOUND. Jaws hit the floor.

---

## PB42 — THE RTO VISIT

Zubair at the RTO. Long queue. Gets to the counter. "I want to register this vehicle." Shows the photos. The officer adjusts his glasses. Turns the photo sideways. Turns it upside down. "Sir... this is a vehicle?" Zubair: "50cc petrol, 2-stroke, disc brakes, 45km/h." Officer: "Sir. Under 50cc doesn't need registration." Zubair: "I KNOW. I just wanted to show someone." Officer, despite himself: "...it IS nice." Sami outside: "ANOTHER FAN."

---

## PB43 — THE AUTO RACE

Traffic signal. Zubair on the pocket bike. A Bangalore auto next to him. Both stare straight ahead. Light turns green. Zubair LAUNCHES — tiny wheels spinning, 2-stroke screaming, he's GONE. Auto driver floors it. No chance. 3 signals later, Zubair is waiting. The auto pulls up. Sami hangs out the auto window: "I'm PAYING Rs. 80 for this ride and you spent Rs. 5 of petrol to DESTROY us."

---

## PB44 — THE OVERLOADED

Zubair straps a massive bag on the pocket bike. A box on top. A bag on the side. The cargo is 3x the size of the bike. He starts riding. From behind, all you see is luggage moving at 30km/h. The bike is invisible. Sami walking alongside, filming: "Bro, it looks like a pile of boxes gained consciousness and learned to drive."

---

## PB45 — THE COLONY ALARM

5:30 AM. Silent colony. Zubair pull-starts the pocket bike. The 2-stroke SHATTERS the silence. EVERY window lights up. Dogs bark. Babies cry. One uncle on a balcony in a lungi: "WHAT TIME IS IT?!" Zubair, already on the move: "MORNING RIDE, UNCLE!" Sami running behind: "GO BEFORE THEY FORM A MOB!" The colony's new alarm clock.

---

## PB46 — THE TWO-UP

Both Zubair and Sami on the pocket bike. 90kg load capacity — they BARELY make it. Two grown men on a bike smaller than a chair. Knees overlapping. Helmets touching. Riding at 20km/h through the colony. A kid on a regular bicycle rides past and looks DOWN at them. The role reversal is complete. But Zubair and Sami are laughing so hard they can barely steer.

---

## PB47 — THE DOG CHASE

A street dog spots Zubair on the pocket bike. The dog is TALLER than the bike. Chase begins. Zubair: "SAMI! SAMI IT'S CHASING ME!" Full throttle — 45km/h. The dog is MATCHING him. Sharp turn — the disc brakes save his life. Dog slides past. Zubair stops, panting. Looks at the bike with new respect: "The disc brakes just earned their keep." Sami filming from a tree: "THE DOG IS BIGGER THAN YOUR BIKE."

---

## PB48 — THE RAIN

Heavy Bangalore rain. Traffic stopped. Autos pulled over. Cars crawling. One tiny figure cutting through it all at ground level — Zubair on the pocket bike, rain hammering his helmet, tiny knobby tires gripping the wet road. Arrives at the destination. Soaked. But ON TIME. Sami, arriving 40 minutes later by auto: "How?" Zubair: "18cm ground clearance. Knobby tires. And no driver who says 'meter double in rain.'"

---

## PB49 — THE MUSEUM

Zubair builds a display in his room. Tiny platform. Spotlight from a desk lamp. Red rope barrier (it's a shoelace). When Sami and friends visit, they get a "guided tour." Zubair, wearing a blazer: "Notice the alloy exhaust. Observe the upside-down fork absorbers. The disc brakes — front AND rear." Friend reaches out to touch. Zubair slaps the hand: "LOOK. DON'T TOUCH." Sami: "It's a bike, not the Kohinoor." Zubair: "To me, it is."

---

## PB50 — THE CHAIN REACTION

Zubair riding the pocket bike through the colony. A kid on the street freezes. Eyes HUGE. Runs to his dad: "I WANT THAT." Dad looks at the pocket bike. Looks at the kid. Looks at the pocket bike again. Zubair stops. Lets the kid sit on it — it's the PERFECT size for a kid. The kid's face LIGHTS UP. Dad takes a photo. Asks: "Where'd you get this?" Zubair: "BCH. Bharath Cycle Hub." Dad saves the number. Sami filming: "That's 3 customers today. Just from RIDING." Zubair: "You don't sell a pocket bike. You just let people SEE it."

---

*50 concepts. Zubair and Sami. One pocket bike. The comedy is built into the product — a tiny bike with big bike energy. Every concept exploits the size mismatch, the sound mismatch, or the attitude mismatch. The bike sells itself; the content just shows it in the wild.*

---

# SERIES 2 — PB51 to PB100 (FEATURES & BENEFITS)

**Context:** 50 new visual-hook concepts. Each one highlights a specific feature or benefit through absurd, real-world comedy. The feature is NEVER announced — it's revealed through the situation. The concept IS the hook.

---

## PB51 — THE DOUBLE START

Rainy morning. Cold. Zubair hits the button start. Engine fires instantly. Sami, impressed: "Nice." CUT TO — next week. Battery dead. Sami: "Now what?" Zubair grabs the pull cord. One violent yank — the 2-stroke SCREAMS alive. Rain spraying off the exhaust. Sami jumps back. "IT HAS TWO START SYSTEMS?!" Zubair, already riding off in the rain: "This bike starts in an apocalypse, Sami." Sami standing in the rain, his scooter dead with a flat battery: "I'm walking today."

---

## PB52 — THE PETROL RECEIPT WALL

Zubair keeps every fuel receipt for a month. Pins them to a wall. One receipt per week. 4 receipts total. Each one says Rs. 150. TOTAL: Rs. 600 for the entire month. He takes a photo. Posts it to the group chat. 47 messages in 2 minutes. "FAKE." "PHOTOSHOPPED." "BRO THAT'S MY DAILY AUTO FARE." Sami reading messages aloud, laughing: "They don't believe you." Zubair: "35 KMPL, Sami. 1.5 litre tank. Rs. 150 per week. The receipts don't lie." Holds up the receipts like evidence in court.

---

## PB53 — THE EMERGENCY BRAKE

Zubair riding full speed — 45km/h. A coconut rolls onto the road. He SLAMS both disc brakes AND hits the emergency stop switch. Bike STOPS. Dead. Engine cuts. The coconut is 2 inches from the front tire. Silence. Zubair's hands shaking on the handlebar. Sami running up: "How did you—" Zubair: "Front disc. Rear disc. Emergency kill switch. THREE things just stopped this bike in 2 metres." Picks up the coconut. Puts it on the seat. "You owe me your life, coconut." Rides off with the coconut.

---

## PB54 — THE SHOULDER CARRY

Dead Bangalore traffic. Silk Board junction. Nothing moving. Zubair gets off. PICKS UP the entire bike with one hand. Puts it on his shoulder. Walks between every stuck car, auto, and bus. Reaches the other side. Puts the bike down. Starts it. Rides away. An auto driver watched the ENTIRE thing: "Anna... did that man just CARRY a motorbike on his SHOULDER?" His passenger: "23 kilos, apparently." Auto driver, whispering: "Where do I get one?"

---

## PB55 — THE STAIRCASE DELIVERY

Zubair orders something online. Delivery guy calls: "I'm downstairs." Zubair goes down. It's the pocket bike — just arrived from BCH, still in the box. The delivery guy couldn't bring it up. Zubair picks up the ENTIRE BOX, walks up 4 flights of stairs, doesn't even breathe hard. Opens it in his bedroom. Neighbor comes to see: "You just carried a motorcycle up 4 floors?" Zubair: "23 kilos. That's lighter than your wife's suitcase when she goes to her mother's house." Neighbor: "...facts."

---

## PB56 — THE KNOBBY GRIP

Rain-soaked road. Sami on a regular scooter — back tire slides, bike wobbles, he puts both feet down in a puddle. Soaked. Zubair on the pocket bike — knobby off-road tires GRIP the wet road like claws. Rides straight through the same puddle. Doesn't flinch. Rides THROUGH a muddy patch. Still stable. Sami pulling his scooter out of a slide: "HOW." Zubair, not even looking back: "Knobby tires, Sami. This is a DIRT bike. Dirt is in the NAME."

---

## PB57 — THE GROUND CLEARANCE

Bangalore's worst pothole — more crater than road. A sedan bottoms out, scraping sounds, driver winces. An auto goes around it, adding 5 minutes. Zubair on the pocket bike rides STRAIGHT through it. 18cm ground clearance. Knobby tires. Doesn't even slow down. The bike eats the pothole like it's flat road. Car driver rolls down his window: "WHAT IS THAT THING?" Zubair: "18cm clearance. Your Innova has 17. I have 18. On a bike that weighs less than your spare tire."

---

## PB58 — THE AIR COOLED

Bike meetup. Summer. 40 degrees. A guy with a liquid-cooled bike: radiator fan screaming, coolant temperature climbing, he's worried. Another guy's bike is dripping coolant — pipe burst. Zubair rides in. Parks. Everyone waits for his bike to overheat too. 30 minutes pass. Nothing. No fan. No radiator. No coolant. No temperature gauge because there's nothing TO gauge. "Air-cooled." Pats the engine. Warm. That's it. "No radiator to break. No coolant to leak. The AIR does the work." The overheating guy: "I spent Rs. 8,000 fixing my radiator last month." Zubair: "I spent Rs. 150. On petrol. For the whole week."

---

## PB59 — THE FORK FLEX

Camera starts TIGHT on golden upside-down forks. Gleaming. Professional. Slow pan up — everyone expects a KTM Duke or a Ducati. Camera reveals: it's the pocket bike. Parked next to a KTM Duke. Both have USD forks. Zubair: "Same suspension technology." Points at the KTM: "2.5 lakhs." Points at the pocket bike: "Fraction of that." The KTM owner squats down to compare. Gets uncomfortably quiet. "These ARE the same forks." Sami: "The look on his face when a pocket bike had his same suspension: PRICELESS."

---

## PB60 — THE SHOCK ADJUSTMENT

Zubair shows the rear shock absorber. Clicks to soft. Rides over a speed breaker: smooth, comfortable, zero drama. Clicks to stiff. Same speed breaker: firm, sporty, holds the line. Then a 90kg guy gets on. Zubair adjusts the preload. Rides perfectly. No sag, no bottoming out. Sami: "Adjustable shock absorbers. On something that costs less than most people's HELMETS." The 90kg guy refuses to get off: "I'm taking this home." Zubair: "That's the display model." "I DON'T CARE."

## PB61 — THE 90KG MAN

The biggest guy at BCH walks in. Full unit. 90 kilos minimum. Looks at the pocket bike. Everyone tenses — this can't end well. He sits on it. The bike holds. Suspension compresses — then holds. He twists the throttle. The bike MOVES. With a 90kg man on it. Slowly at first, then full speed. He's doing laps of the parking lot with his knees above the handlebars. Laughing like a kid. Comes back: "My Bullet can't make me smile like this." Sami to camera: "90kg load capacity. We didn't lie."

---

## PB62 — THE COLOUR DROP

BCH showroom. All 4 pocket bikes lined up: yellow, red, green, orange. Each one lit with a spotlight. Zubair, wearing a black turtleneck like he's at a product launch: "Ladies and gentlemen. Four colours. Four personalities." Points at yellow: "For the Rocky Bhai in you." Red: "For the racer." Green: "For the machine." Orange: "For the KTM dreams on a pocket bike budget." A customer stands there paralyzed. Can't choose. Been standing for 20 minutes. Sami: "Sir, they're all the same bike." Customer: "THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. The yellow SPEAKS to me but the orange SCREAMS."

---

## PB63 — THE ONE-LITRE DARE

Zubair at the bunk. "One litre. Exactly." Rs. 100. Starts a GPS tracker on his phone. Rides. Through Koramangala. Indiranagar. MG Road. Whitefield. And BACK. The phone shows 35km. On ONE litre. Zubair parks with the engine still running. "35 KMPL. The DARE was to see if the spec was real. It's not just real — I could've gone FURTHER." Sami checking the GPS: "Bro, you've basically circled half of Bangalore on one litre. My car does that distance on 4 litres." Zubair: "Welcome to 50cc life."

---

## PB64 — THE ELEVATOR AMBUSH

Zubair rolls the pocket bike into an apartment elevator. Presses 5. Doors close. Door opens on 2: an uncle in a lungi. Sees the bike IN the elevator. Freezes. "Yeh kya hai?" Zubair: "Good morning uncle." Door opens on 3: an aunty with a milk packet. "MOTOR BIKE? IN THE LIFT?!" Zubair: "It's only 23 kilos, aunty." Door opens on 5: Zubair rolls the bike out, rides down the corridor, parks it INSIDE his flat. The elevator descends. The uncle and aunty stare at each other. "Did that just happen?" Sami was in the flat the whole time, filming through the peephole: "EVERY floor. Same reaction. EVERY TIME."

---

## PB65 — THE CHAIN OIL

Sami at the mechanic. His regular bike's chain needs service: Rs. 300, takes 45 minutes, grease everywhere, mechanic complaining about tension. Meanwhile Zubair in his backyard: sprays chain lube on the pocket bike's chain in 20 seconds. Wipes it with a cloth. Done. Gets on. Rides to Sami. "You're still here?" Sami, covered in grease: "The chain is STILL not right." Zubair: "Chain drive. Small chain. One spray can lasts 6 months. Total maintenance time: under a minute." Rides off. Sami to the mechanic: "How much longer?" Mechanic: "30 minutes." Sami puts his head in his hands.

---

## PB66 — THE HIDDEN MOTORCYCLE

Sami comes to Zubair's house. "Where's the bike?" Zubair: "Hidden." Sami searches. Behind the door — no. Under the table — no. Behind the sofa — no. Inside the cupboard — no. Opens the BALCONY — the pocket bike is parked next to a plant pot. The plant is TALLER than the bike. Sami walked past it THREE times: "I LOOKED AT THE BALCONY! I thought it was a TOY!" Zubair: "1200 by 580mm. It hides behind FURNITURE. Try hiding your Pulsar behind a CURTAIN." Sami: "This is a motor vehicle that plays hide and seek."

---

## PB67 — THE WEIGHING SCALE

Zubair brings a bathroom scale. Places objects: a full suitcase (23kg), a big water can (20kg), Sami's gym bag (18kg). Then the pocket bike: 23kg. Exactly the same as a suitcase. "My bike weighs the same as your LUGGAGE." Sami: "So theoretically..." Zubair: "Yes, you could check it in at the airport." Sami: "I was going to say theoretically you could lift it overhead." Zubair lifts the bike overhead with both hands. Holds it. "LIGHTER THAN A BARBELL!" Sami: "Put it down before the neighbours call the police."

---

## PB68 — THE SEAT HEIGHT TRICK

Zubair at a tea stall. Doesn't get off the pocket bike. Sits on it and reaches the counter perfectly — seat height is 62cm, basically chair height. Orders chai. Drinks it. Sitting on the bike. At counter height. Like he's on a bar stool. The chai guy stares: "Is that... are you sitting on a BIKE?" Zubair: "62cm seat height. Same as your stool." Points at the chai stall stool. Same height. "I'm basically sitting on a chair that goes 45km/h." Finishes chai. Rides off. Still at chair height. Sami at the counter: "One chai please. I'll sit on a NORMAL stool."

---

## PB69 — THE BOOT FIT

Zubair opens the trunk of a regular sedan. Lifts the pocket bike. Puts it INSIDE the boot. Closes the boot. It fits. PERFECTLY. Drives the car to a location. Opens boot. Pulls the bike out. Starts it. Rides the last mile. Sami: "You just transported a MOTORCYCLE inside a CAR." Zubair: "First mile: car. Last mile: pocket bike. This is how billionaires think." Sami: "Billionaires don't ride pocket bikes." Zubair: "Billionaires don't have this much fun EITHER."

---

## PB70 — THE DISC BRAKE TEA TEST

Zubair places a full cup of chai on a wall. 15 metres away. Full speed — 45km/h. Heading straight for the wall. SLAMS both discs at the last second. Bike stops. Front tire barely kisses the wall. Chai doesn't spill. Picks up the cup. Takes a sip. "Dual disc brakes, Sami. Front AND rear." Sami, who covered his eyes: "I thought you were going to hit the wall." Zubair: "Disc brakes don't let you hit walls. That's the whole point." Sami: "Some scooters worth 80 thousand still have drum brakes." Zubair sips chai: "And they can't stop like this."

---

## PB71 — THE EXHAUST NOTE PRANK

Zubair records the pocket bike's exhaust note — raw, angry 2-stroke through alloy exhaust. Takes the recording to a bikers' café. Plays it on a Bluetooth speaker. Full volume. Everyone's heads snap: "WHAT IS THAT?! That sounds INSANE." "Is that a 2-stroke racing bike?" People running outside to find the source. Zubair stops the audio. Shows his phone: "50cc pocket bike." Dead silence. Then: "NO WAY." He walks to the parking lot. Starts the ACTUAL bike. SAME SOUND. One guy drops his helmet: "The alloy exhaust. That's what's doing it. THAT'S why it sounds like a 250." Sami: "50cc lying about its age."

---

## PB72 — THE NO-LICENSE FLEX

Zubair at a traffic signal. Cop checking documents. Pulls everyone over. Zubair rides past. Cop whistles. "Hey! License?" Zubair: "Under 50cc, sir. No license required." Cop squints. Walks around the tiny bike. "Registration?" Zubair: "Under 50cc. No registration required." Cop: "Insurance?" Zubair: "Under 50cc—" Cop: "WHAT CAN'T this thing do?" Zubair: "Fit inside your cop car. Actually wait..." looks at the cop car boot. Looks at the bike. "It probably CAN." Cop trying not to laugh. Sami recording from behind: "He's getting away with EVERYTHING."

---

## PB73 — THE WHEELBASE STEP-OVER

Zubair standing next to the pocket bike. The wheelbase is 86cm — shorter than his leg. He STEPS OVER the entire bike. Like stepping over a puddle. Gets on from the wrong side. Steps over again to get off. "86cm wheelbase. I can step over my own vehicle." A Bullet owner next to him tries to step over his bike. Can't. Hits the seat. Almost falls. Zubair, already riding away: "NOT EVERYONE'S BIKE IS STEP-OVER FRIENDLY!"

---

## PB74 — THE 12-VOLT POWER

Zubair plugs a phone charger into the pocket bike's 12V system. Phone charges while riding. Plugs in an LED strip — underglow activates. Plugs in an air horn — BLASTS it. A truck-grade horn from a bike smaller than a chair. Everyone on the road JUMPS. "12V battery. Same voltage as a car. I can power ANYTHING on this thing." Sami: "He's got underglow and a truck horn on a 23-kilo bike. We've created a MONSTER." Zubair, hitting the horn at a traffic light: Everyone looks around for the truck. Sees nothing. Looks DOWN. Zubair waves.

---

## PB75 — THE MECHANIC'S PALM

Zubair at a mechanic's shop. "Disc brake pad replacement." Mechanic: "Which bike?" Zubair points at the pocket bike. Mechanic walks to it. Squats. The brake rotor is the size of his PALM. "Bhai... this has DISC brakes?" Looks closer. "Front AND rear?!" Calls his assistant: "Come see this. Disc brakes on both wheels on something smaller than a stool." Changes the pads in 5 minutes — the parts are tiny. Total cost: barely anything. Mechanic refuses to charge full price: "I can't charge bike rates for something I can pick up with one hand." Sami: "Low maintenance AND low service costs."

---

## PB76 — THE FUEL TANK REVEAL

Zubair at the petrol bunk. "Full tank please." Attendant puts the nozzle in. Starts filling. 3 seconds later — CLICK. Done. Full. "Bhai... the meter says Rs. 150." Attendant looks at the nozzle. Tries again. Click. "It IS full." Calls his colleague: "This thing's tank is the size of a WATER BOTTLE." Zubair: "1.5 litres. That's the whole tank." Attendant doing mental math: "Rs. 150... full tank... how far does this go?" Zubair: "52 kilometres." Attendant drops the nozzle: "I fill trucks all day. TRUCKS. And this tiny thing has better mileage than ALL of them." Sami: "35 KMPL will do that."

---

## PB77 — THE PARKING ANYWHERE

Zubair parks the pocket bike in impossible places. Inside a café — between two tables. Nobody notices until the engine starts. In a shop — next to the display shelf. Shopkeeper doesn't realize there's a MOTORCYCLE in his store. At the temple — in the shoe rack area. The bike is shorter than the rack. At a wedding — under the buffet table. UNDER IT. A kid finds it and screams. "1200mm by 580mm. I park where BICYCLES can't park." Sami following with the camera: "He's parked a motor vehicle in 7 impossible places today. NOBODY asked him to stop."

---

## PB78 — THE DAD AND KID

A father and his 10-year-old at BCH. The kid sits on the pocket bike — PERFECT fit. The seat height (62cm) is exactly right for a kid. His feet touch the ground. Hands reach the bars. He looks like a miniature MotoGP racer. The dad sits on it next — his knees are at his chest but he's GRINNING. They take turns. The kid pulls the pull start himself — the engine fires. His face: pure shock, then pure joy. Dad to camera: "I came here for a cycle. I'm leaving with THIS." Kid already doing laps: "DAD I'M NOT STOPPING."

---

## PB79 — THE SPEED BREAKER LAUNCH

Bangalore's tallest speed breaker. The one that scrapes EVERY car. A sedan hits it — SCRAAAPE. An auto hits it — passengers bounce. Zubair on the pocket bike hits it at speed — 18cm clearance means the bike LAUNCHES off it. Both wheels in the air. Adjustable shock absorbs the landing. He doesn't even wobble. Keeps riding. The sedan driver is checking for damage under his car. The auto passengers are rubbing their backs. Zubair, already a block away: "18cm ground clearance. Adjustable shock. Speed breakers aren't obstacles — they're JUMPS." Sami from the footpath: "He's the only person in Bangalore who ENJOYS speed breakers."

---

## PB80 — THE PULL START CINEMA

HOOK: Close-up of a hand gripping a pull cord. YANK — nothing. Again — nothing. Third time — FULL FORCE — the 2-stroke EXPLODES to life. Raw, angry, violent sound. The camera is shaking. The exhaust spits. SLOW MOTION of Zubair getting on. Dust settling around the tiny wheels. KGF music. From the low camera angle, the pocket bike looks MASSIVE. Zubair's silhouette against the morning sun. He rides off in DRAMATIC slow motion. Then Sami breaks the fourth wall: "It's a pocket bike, guys. He does this every morning. The neighbours have filed 3 complaints."

---

## PB81 — THE AUTO FARE MATH

Zubair next to an auto. "Silk Board to Koramangala. How much?" Auto driver: "Rs. 150." Zubair: "Rs. 150. That's a FULL TANK on my pocket bike. Your Rs. 150 gets me 3km in your auto. My Rs. 150 gets me 52km on my bike." Auto driver pauses. "52 KILOMETRES?" Zubair: "35 KMPL. 1.5 litre tank. Do the math." Auto driver pulls out his phone calculator. Does the math. Goes silent. "Where do I buy this?" Sami pops out from behind: "BCH, anna. Bharath Cycle Hub." Auto driver: "Not for a customer. FOR ME. For my off-duty rides."

---

## PB82 — THE BUCKET WASH

Zubair washing the pocket bike. One bucket of water. One sponge. 3 minutes. Done. The entire bike is clean because the entire bike is 1200mm long. Total water used: half a bucket. Total time: less than washing dishes. Sami next to him, washing his regular bike: 3 buckets, 25 minutes, still not done, back hurting. "HOW are you done already?!" Zubair: "There's less bike TO wash. That's the advantage of small." Puts the bike inside the house to dry. INSIDE. Next to the sofa. "Drying indoors like laundry." Sami still outside, hose in hand, wet and miserable.

---

## PB83 — THE SOUND-OFF REVEAL

Black screen. Audio only. A VICIOUS 2-stroke engine scream — revving, echoing, aggressive. Sounds like a dirt bike championship. Getting louder. More intense. You're picturing a massive motocross machine. Camera slowly fades in. It's the pocket bike. Barely 2 feet tall. The alloy exhaust pipe making it sound like it has 5x the displacement. Zubair sitting on it, knees at chest height, dead serious face. Sami with a decibel meter: "50cc. Sounds like 250. Alloy exhaust doesn't lie." Zubair revs again. A window opens 3 buildings away: "TURN THAT THING OFF!" Zubair: "Respect from 3 buildings away. On 50cc."

---

## PB84 — THE FLAT-BED RECOVERY

The pocket bike won't start (for the bit). Zubair calls a tow truck. The tow truck arrives — massive flatbed. Driver looks at the pocket bike. Looks at his truck. "Sir... this is what I'm towing?" Zubair: "Careful with her." The driver PICKS UP the bike with one hand and places it on the flatbed. The bike takes up 5% of the truck. The driver pulls out his phone to take a photo: "In 15 years, I have NEVER towed something I could carry with one hand." Sami: "23 kilos. Even the tow truck driver is impressed." The driver, driving off: "I want one."

---

## PB85 — THE PARALLEL PARKING

Parking nightmare. Mall. Full. Cars circling for 20 minutes looking for spots. Zubair spots a gap between a Fortuner and a wall — maybe 2 feet wide. Not a parking space. He slides the pocket bike RIGHT IN. Perfect fit. The bike is INVISIBLE between the SUV and the wall. Locks it. Walks into the mall. Sami: "He just parked in a CRACK in the wall." Another car driver who's been circling: "That's NOT a parking space!" Zubair, walking away: "It is NOW."

---

## PB86 — THE BUDGET SUPERBIKE

Whiteboard at BCH. Two columns: "SUPERBIKE" vs "POCKET BIKE." Disc brakes on both wheels? Both. USD front forks? Both. Adjustable rear suspension? Both. Alloy exhaust? Both. Chain drive? Both. Pull start + button start? Only pocket bike (superbikes don't have pull start). Can fit in an elevator? Only pocket bike. Can be carried on your shoulder? Only pocket bike. Rs. 150 full tank for a week? Only pocket bike. Zubair taps the board: "Everything a superbike has... plus things a superbike CAN'T do." Sami: "And one of these needs a bank loan."

---

## PB87 — THE PICKUP TRUCK

Zubair picks up the pocket bike. Puts it in the back of a friend's pickup truck. Then ALSO puts a sofa, two boxes, and grocery bags AROUND the bike. The bike takes up less space than the groceries. Arrives at destination. Takes the bike out from between the boxes. Starts it. Rides the last 2 km. "My motorcycle is also a parcel. It rides with the CARGO." Friend: "I forgot the bike was back there. I thought it was another box." Sami: "23 kilos. Fits anywhere. The world's most portable motorcycle."

---

## PB88 — THE WALKING COMPARISON

Split screen. LEFT: Sami walking to the shop — 500m, takes 7 minutes, arrives sweaty. RIGHT: Zubair on the pocket bike — 500m, takes 40 seconds, Rs. 2 worth of petrol, arrives fresh. LEFT: Sami walking back with grocery bags — 12 minutes, arms hurting. RIGHT: Zubair, bags on the handlebar — 40 seconds, zero effort. Daily savings: 20 minutes and zero sweat. Weekly: 2+ hours. Monthly: almost a full day of LIFE saved. Sami doing the annual math: "12 DAYS. I lose 12 days a year WALKING to errands you do in seconds."

---

## PB89 — THE COURIER BIKE

Zubair wraps the pocket bike in bubble wrap. Puts it in its original carton — 1100 x 270 x 560mm. Takes it to a courier service. "Standard parcel." Counter guy weighs it: 23kg. Measures it. "What's in this, sir?" Zubair: "A motorcycle." The counter guy LAUGHS. Opens it. Stops laughing. Starts it (inside the courier shop — everyone runs). "YOU CAN COURIER A MOTORCYCLE?!" Zubair: "Standard shipping rates. 23 kilos. Try shipping a Bullet, bhai." Counter guy on the phone to his manager: "Sir you're not going to BELIEVE what just came in."

---

## PB90 — THE VALET SHOCK

Zubair outside a restaurant with valet parking. Full confidence. Rolls up on the pocket bike. Valet guy comes over. "Sir, I'll park—" reaches for the bike. Lifts the ENTIRE THING. In one hand. Walks it to the corner. Places it next to the shoe rack. The shoe rack is TALLER. Zubair, offended: "That's a vehicle, sir. Please give it a PROPER spot." Valet, trying to keep a straight face: "Sir, it fits between two potted plants." Sami: "The valet parked it in the RECEPTION AREA. Next to the umbrella stand."

---

## PB91 — THE AUTOMATIC FLEX

Zubair teaches Sami to ride the pocket bike. "Where's the clutch?" Zubair: "No clutch." "Where are the gears?" "No gears." "So how do I—" "Twist. And go." Sami twists the throttle. TAKES OFF. 45km/h in seconds. No stalling, no jerking, no gear shifting. Just pure twist-and-go. Comes back laughing: "THAT'S IT?! No clutch, no gears, just TWIST?!" Zubair: "Automatic transmission. Welcome to the future." Sami: "I spent 3 months learning gear shifting on my bike. This took 3 SECONDS."

---

## PB92 — THE ROAD AND DIRT

Part 1: Zubair on a paved road. Smooth ride. 45km/h. Normal. Part 2: Takes a right turn into a muddy off-road trail. Knobby tires GRIP. Bounces over rocks. Splashes through a puddle. 18cm clearance eats every bump. Adjustable shock handles the terrain change. ZERO problem. Back on the road. No tire change. No adjustment. Same bike, both surfaces. Sami on a scooter, stuck at the edge of the dirt trail, road tires useless: "I CAN'T FOLLOW YOU THERE!" Zubair, already on the dirt: "That's why it's called a DIRT bike, Sami. Road AND dirt. Both."

---

## PB93 — THE BATTERY BACKUP

Zubair is 10km from home. Button start: nothing. Battery died on the ride. On any other electric-start bike, you're STRANDED. Zubair calmly reaches for the pull cord. One yank. ENGINE FIRES. Rides home. Charges the 12V battery overnight. Next morning: button start works again. "Two start systems. Even when one dies, you're NEVER stuck." Sami: "What do other people do when their battery dies?" Zubair: "They call a mechanic. I pull a cord." Sami: "That's the most 'I don't need anyone' energy I've ever seen."

---

## PB94 — THE WEIGHT CHALLENGE

BCH store. Challenge: every customer has to GUESS the bike's weight before getting on it. Guesses: "60 kilos." "50." "Maybe 40?" "At least 35." Everyone overestimates. Nobody — NOBODY — guesses 23. When they find out, the reaction is always the same: "23?! THAT'S IT?!" And then they pick it up. And then they can't stop picking it up. Compilation of 10 different people lifting the bike overhead, side-carrying it, one-hand carrying it. All with the same shocked face. Sami: "Nobody believes it until they LIFT it."

---

## PB95 — THE NARROW LANE

Bangalore's narrowest lane. Two walls, barely 3 feet apart. Cars can't enter. Autos can't enter. Regular bikes STRUGGLE — handlebars scrape walls. Zubair on the pocket bike slides through like water. The bike is narrower than the lane. He rides through WITHOUT touching either wall. Comes out the other side. Sami had to go AROUND the entire block: "That lane cut 15 minutes off your route!" Zubair: "The bike is 580mm wide. These lanes are made for it." Points at the lane: "That's not a shortcut for cars. That's a HIGHWAY for a pocket bike."

---

## PB96 — THE REAL MILEAGE TEST

Zubair fills exactly 1.5 litres (full tank, Rs. 150). Resets the trip meter. Rides normally — not slow, not fast, just regular commuting. Errands, chai runs, friend's house, store, back home. Day 1: 7km. Day 2: 8km. Day 3: 6km. Day 4: 7km. Day 5: 8km. Day 6: 7km. Day 7: fuel light comes on after 9.5km — he pulls into the bunk. Total: 52.5km on one tank. "7 days. Rs. 150. 52 kilometres. They told you the specs. I LIVED the specs." Sami holding the logbook: "35 KMPL. It's real. I kept the receipts."

---

## PB97 — THE RUSH HOUR GHOST

Peak Bangalore traffic. 6 PM. Outer Ring Road. Nothing moving. Except Zubair. The pocket bike is so small and so narrow that it THREADS between bumper-to-bumper vehicles like it doesn't exist. Cars can't see him. Autos don't even notice. He's a ghost moving through a frozen city. Passes 50 vehicles in 2 minutes. Arrives at the destination while Sami is still at the SAME signal. Sami calls: "Where are you?" Zubair, already sitting at the restaurant: "Ordered your food. Hurry up." Sami, looking at the wall of traffic: "I need a pocket bike."

---

## PB98 — THE MONSOON WARRIOR

Peak Bangalore monsoon. Water-logged road. Everyone stopped. Zubair on the pocket bike — knobby tires, 18cm ground clearance — rides through 6 inches of water. The off-road tires grip. The engine (air-cooled, no radiator to flood) keeps running. He rides through the waterlogged stretch while buses are stalled and cars are flooded. Arrives dry(ish). Sami in an auto that's stuck in the water: "THE AUTO ENGINE DIED. YOUR 50CC SURVIVED?!" Zubair: "Air-cooled. No radiator. Knobby tires. 18cm clearance. This bike was BORN for Bangalore monsoons."

---

## PB99 — THE FEATURE DUEL

Two chairs. Zubair in one, Sami in the other. Sami reads features off his Rs. 1.5 lakh bike: "Disc brakes." Zubair: "Same." Sami: "Telescopic forks." Zubair: "Inverted forks. BETTER." Sami: "5-speed manual." Zubair: "Automatic. EASIER." Sami: "15 litres tank." Zubair: "1.5 litres. CHEAPER." Sami: "145 kg." Zubair: "23 kg. I can CARRY mine." Sami: "License needed." Zubair: "No license." Sami runs out of features. Zubair: "Pull start?" Sami: "...no." Zubair: "Emergency stop?" Sami: "...no." Zubair leans back: "50cc. Costs a fraction. Beats you on half the specs. Checkmate." Sami throws his helmet.

---

## PB100 — THE SUNRISE RIDE

4:30 AM. Bangalore is empty. Silent. Zubair pull-starts the pocket bike — the 2-stroke echo bounces off every building. Just him and the road. Low camera angle: the pocket bike against a massive Bangalore sunrise. Silhouette shot. He rides through empty streets — Cubbon Park, MG Road, Brigade Road — all empty. Just a man and his 50cc. No traffic. No chaos. Just freedom. He stops at a chai stall that just opened. The only customer. Chai in hand. Bike ticking next to him. "1.5 litres. 35 KMPL. 23 kilos. 45km/h. Disc brakes. Inverted forks. Adjustable shock. Pull start AND button start. Air-cooled. No license. Fits in an elevator. Costs less than your monthly auto fare." Takes a sip. "But the real feature?" Looks at the sunrise. "This feeling." Sami's alarm rings. He's still in bed. Title: ORION SUPER DIRT BIKE. Available at Bharath Cycle Hub.

---

*50 concepts. PB51–PB100. Every feature and benefit of the Orion Super Dirt Bike — from dual disc brakes to 35 KMPL to air-cooling to knobby tires — revealed through comedy, not spec sheets. The bike sells itself; the content just puts it in situations where it can.*
