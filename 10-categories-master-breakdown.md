# 10 Categories — Master Breakdown

## Category 1: AWARENESS (10 videos)

**Goal:** Introduce BCH and e-cycles to cold audiences who don't know the category exists.

### TG Split (10 videos)
- **Kids 14-17:** 4 videos (status/cool factor discovery)
- **Fitness Adults 30+:** 3 videos (e-cycle as fitness solution)
- **Office Commuters:** 3 videos (e-cycle as commute alternative)

### Concept Themes
- "Everyone's switching and you don't know yet" — category discovery through FOMO
- "This replaces your [petrol/gym/traffic]" — pain-point comparison hooks
- "The thing your friend has that you haven't noticed" — social proof discovery
- Comedy-first entertainment that happens to feature e-cycles

### 800+ Strategy
Frame discovery as identity revelation ("people like you already know") not product education. Entertainment wrapping raises Safety (S=10), identity framing raises I to 9+.

### Primary Formula Pool
- **F1:** BCH v44 (Breaking News), BCH v9 (Shock), BCH v80 (Comedy), TS v13 (Ironic Joy)
- **F2:** TS v18 (J-Curve), BCH v9 (Spike-Settle), BCH v80 (Comedy-PAS), TS v12 (Double Peak)
- **F4:** TS v13 (Tribal Tag 810), TS v18 (Friendship 900), TS v27 (Tribal Identity 810)

## Category 2: CONSIDERATION (10 videos)

**Goal:** Help comparison, build trust, answer "which one?" and "is it worth it?"

### TG Split (10 videos)
- **Fathers:** 4 videos (price/value/EMI analysis, smart buyer identity)
- **Mothers:** 3 videos (safety specs, service reliability, customer reviews)
- **Adults (Fitness + Commute):** 3 videos (practical use-case validation)

### Concept Themes
- "The father who thought it was too expensive — until he saw this" — objection-demolishing stories
- "What mothers actually ask before buying" — safety trust-building
- "I compared 5 options, here's what I found" — authority positioning
- Real customer testimonials wrapped in emotional narratives

### 800+ Strategy
Wrap specs in emotional father/mother narratives. Father buying = pride story (I=9). Mother's safety research = protective love (E=9). Never present specs alone — always through a character's emotional journey.

### Primary Formula Pool
- **F1:** TS v25 (Father Betrayal), TS v12 (Emotional Bait), BCH v69 (Deal Proof), BCH v59 (Price Fire)
- **F2:** TS v25 (Inverted U 9.0), TS v12 (Double Peak 8.9), BCH v59 (Skepticism Converter), BCH v14 (Gift Cascade)
- **F4:** TS v5 (Experience Transfer 810), TS v44 (Family Tag 810), TS v25 (Father Reverence 567→engineer to 800+)

## Category 3: OFFER (10 videos) — PENDING OFFER LIST

**Goal:** Drive immediate action with specific incentives and urgency.

### TG Split (10 videos)
- **Budget Parents (<₹50K income):** 4 videos (EMI ₹999/month magic number)
- **Rich Parents (₹1L+):** 3 videos (guilt-free quick close, premium positioning)
- **All segments:** 3 videos (festival/seasonal/limited-time)

### Concept Themes
- "₹999/month — your kid's dream costs less than your Netflix" — EMI reframing
- Birthday surprise reveals at store
- Festival offer countdowns
- "He negotiated like a pro" — father deal-hunting comedy

### 800+ Strategy
Offer content typically scores low on shares (BCH's deal videos average 400-500 IxExS). Fix: Frame EVERY offer through an emotional story — the joy of giving, the pride of the deal, the surprise on the kid's face. Deal = climax of emotional arc, not the opening.

### Primary Formula Pool
- **F1:** BCH v44 (Breaking News 9.3), BCH v59 (Price Fire 8.4), BCH v69 (Deal Proof 8.4)
- **F2:** TS v44 (Tension Ramp 8.8), BCH v59 (Skepticism Converter 7.9), BCH v14 (Gift Cascade 8.0)
- **F4:** TS v44 (Family Tag 810), TS v31 (Guilt-to-Gratitude 810), BCH v14 (Aspirational Parenting 800)

**STATUS:** Blocked — waiting for offer list from user. Will execute after Categories 1, 4, 5.

## Category 4: PROBLEM-LED CONTENT (10 videos)

**Goal:** Surface specific pain points to create need. Show the problem so vividly the viewer MUST act.

### TG Split (10 videos)
- **Mothers:** 3 videos (screen addiction, safety fears, "bad mother" anxiety)
- **Kids 14-17:** 3 videos (FOMO, boredom, mobility limitations, being left out)
- **Fitness Adults:** 2 videos (failed gym, aging, low energy)
- **Office Commuters:** 2 videos (traffic rage, fuel waste, parking stress)

### Concept Themes
- "My kid hasn't left the house in 3 days" — screen addiction dramatization
- "Everyone rode to the park, I walked" — kid FOMO pain
- "3rd gym membership, same result" — fitness failure narrative
- "2 hours in traffic, ₹500 in fuel, 0 exercise" — commuter pain math
- "My kid asked me WHY his friend has one and he doesn't"

### 800+ Strategy
Problem content is naturally HIGH emotion (E=9-10). Lock identity by making the protagonist an exact mirror of the target viewer (same age, same situation, same words they use). Safety is high because sharing = "I'm protecting someone I care about" (S=10).

### Primary Formula Pool
- **F1:** BCH v15 (Accident Shock 8.8), BCH v9 (Burning Shock 9.0), BCH v80 (Comedy Problem 8.8), TS v2 (Warning 8.5)
- **F2:** TS v2 (Consequence Cinema 9.2), BCH v15 (W-Curve 8.8), BCH v80 (Comedy-PAS 7.8)
- **F4:** TS v2 (Protective Share 900), BCH v15 (Protective Warning 810), TS v50 (Belief Challenge 900)

## Category 5: IDENTITY SHIFT (10 videos)

**Goal:** Show transformation from current identity to aspirational identity. Before/after mindset shift.

### TG Split (10 videos)
- **Kids 14-17:** 3 videos ("awkward kid" → "cool winner", "bored kid" → "adventure kid")
- **Mothers:** 2 videos ("worried helicopter parent" → "modern progressive parent")
- **Fathers:** 2 videos ("unable to provide" → "hero dad who made it happen")
- **Fitness Adults:** 2 videos ("couch potato" → "active, fit person")
- **Commuters:** 1 video ("traffic zombie" → "smart, free commuter")

### Concept Themes
- "The day my son became the cool kid" — parent witnessing kid's status shift
- "I used to be the kid without one" — flashback/transformation story
- "From 'no way' to 'yes way'" — parent belief transformation
- "The guy who cycles to work and everyone notices" — adult identity flip
- "I stopped being the worried mom" — mother liberation narrative

### 800+ Strategy
Identity shift content MAXIMIZES the I score (I=10) because the viewer literally sees themselves in the before-state. Combine with emotional climax at the shift moment (E=9). Safety is naturally high because sharing = aspirational ("I want this for myself/my kid" — S=10).

### Primary Formula Pool
- **F1:** TS v4 (POV Empathy 9.0), TS v41 (Moral Bait-Switch 8.7), TS v24 (Unity Switch 8.6), TS v13 (Ironic Joy 8.8)
- **F2:** TS v4 (Emotional Escalation 9.2), TS v41 (Betrayal Cliff 9.2), TS v24 (Reversal Arc 8.8), TS v18 (J-Curve 9.3)
- **F4:** TS v4 (Identity+Emotion 810), TS v18 (Friendship 900), TS v6 (Moral Message 810)

## Category 6: BEHAVIOUR TARGETING (10 videos)

**Goal:** Nudge specific post-purchase behaviors — ride more, service visits, community participation, prevent the 70% usage drop at 3 months.

### TG Split (10 videos)
- **Gold 20% Kids (active riders):** 4 videos (gamify usage, community, upgrades)
- **Parents:** 3 videos (support daily riding, service awareness, family rides)
- **Fitness Adults:** 3 videos (consistency motivation, distance challenges, habit building)

### Concept Themes
- "30-day ride challenge — can you beat 500km?" — gamification
- "My kid's cycle hasn't moved in 2 months — here's what I did" — re-engagement
- "The kid who rides to school every day vs. the kid who doesn't" — comparison contrast
- "BCH Riders Club" community ride content
- "Service your cycle or lose it" — maintenance awareness through comedy
- "Week 1 vs. Week 12" — habit transformation montage

### 800+ Strategy
Behaviour content risks LOW identity for non-owners. Fix: Frame every behaviour video so NON-owners also relate (the desire to be consistent, the challenge of habits). Share mechanic = tagging friends for challenges (Tribal Tag I=9), pride in consistency (E=8), challenge invitation (S=10).

### Primary Formula Pool
- **F1:** TS v24 (Unity Switch 8.6), BCH v54 (Night Runner 8.3), BCH v32 (Controversy 8.8), TS v13 (Ironic Joy 8.8)
- **F2:** TS v24 (Reversal Arc 8.8), BCH v54 (Loyalty Reward 7.9), BCH v9 (Spike-Settle 8.8)
- **F4:** TS v27 (Tribal Identity 810), TS v13 (Tribal Tag 810), TS v18 (Friendship 900)

## Category 7: CONTEXTUAL TARGETING — LIFE EVENTS (10 videos)

**Goal:** Tie e-cycle purchase to specific life moments — birthdays, exam results, festivals, seasons, milestones.

### TG Split (10 videos)
- **Parents (combined):** 5 videos (birthday gifts, exam rewards, festival gifting)
- **Kids 14-17:** 3 videos (birthday wish, exam celebration, summer freedom)
- **Fitness Adults:** 2 videos (New Year resolution, health scare trigger)

### Concept Themes
- "The birthday that changed everything" — surprise delivery reveal
- "Exam results day → BCH store visit" — reward cycle
- "Summer is coming, are you ready?" — seasonal freedom
- "Diwali gift that keeps moving" — festival positioning
- "Doctor said exercise. I said e-cycle." — health scare trigger
- "First day of college on an e-cycle" — life transition

### 800+ Strategy
Life events are NATURAL 800+ territory. Birthday content = extreme emotion (E=10), high identity for any parent/kid (I=9), completely safe to share (S=10). TS v44 (Family Tag 810) and BCH v14 (Aspirational Parenting 800) prove this works.

### Primary Formula Pool
- **F1:** BCH v21 (Child Savings 8.4), BCH v14 (Achievement 8.25), TS v13 (Ironic Joy 8.8), BCH v44 (Breaking News 9.3)
- **F2:** BCH v21 (Emotional Ascent 8.2), BCH v14 (Gift Cascade 8.0), TS v18 (J-Curve 9.3), TS v44 (Tension Ramp 8.8)
- **F4:** BCH v14 (Aspirational Parenting 800), BCH v21 (Nostalgic Aspiration 800), TS v31 (Guilt-to-Gratitude 810), BCH v2 (Relational Bonding 810)

## Category 8: TARGETING BELIEF SYSTEM (10 videos)

**Goal:** Shift underlying beliefs — "e-cycles = status", "good parents provide modern tools", "cycling is the smart choice."

### TG Split (10 videos)
- **Kids 14-17:** 3 videos (e-cycles = ultimate status symbol, better than PlayStation)
- **Parents:** 4 videos (modern parenting = e-cycles, better than screens, worth the investment)
- **Adults:** 3 videos (cycling = sophisticated/smart, not "uncool")

### Concept Themes
- "Your kid thinks PlayStation is cool? Wait till they see this." — belief clash
- "The myth: e-cycles are toys. The truth:" — myth-busting confrontation
- "25 years, 1 lakh customers. Here's what we've learned." — authority belief
- "The kid who chose an e-cycle over a phone" — counter-narrative
- "Why doctors recommend e-cycles over gym" — expert authority shift
- "When your neighbour's kid rides one, everything changes" — social proof cascade

### 800+ Strategy
Belief content triggers STRONG identity response — viewers either agree or disagree, both drive engagement. The Controversy Crusher pattern (BCH v32, 8.8) and Belief Challenge Share (TS v50, 900) prove confrontational belief content = highest shares. Key: present the belief challenge through a RELATABLE CHARACTER, not a lecture.

### Primary Formula Pool
- **F1:** BCH v32 (Controversy 8.8), TS v41 (Moral Bait-Switch 8.7), TS v50 (Superstition Shock 8.3), BCH v15 (Accident Shock 8.8)
- **F2:** TS v41 (Betrayal Cliff 9.2), TS v2 (Consequence Cinema 9.2), BCH v15 (W-Curve 8.8), BCH v32 (V-Curve 8.3)
- **F4:** TS v50 (Belief Challenge 900), TS v6 (Moral Message 810), TS v2 (Protective 900)

## Category 9: EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE — Fear, Anxiety, Hidden Desire (10 videos)

**Goal:** Resonate with and normalize deep emotional states. Surface what viewers feel but don't say.

### TG Split (10 videos)
- **Mothers:** 3 videos (safety fear, "bad mother" anxiety, control/guilt)
- **Kids 14-17:** 3 videos (popularity desire, FOMO pain, "left out" anxiety)
- **Fathers:** 2 videos ("can't provide" guilt, pride hunger, childhood wound)
- **Fitness Adults:** 2 videos (body shame, failed attempts, aging anxiety)

### Concept Themes
- **Fear:** "What if something happens to my kid on the road?" — mother's nightmare scenario
- **Anxiety:** "Everyone's buying, I can't afford it" — financial anxiety → EMI solution
- **Hidden Desire:** "I just want my friends to think I'm cool" — kid's unspoken truth
- **Emotional Trigger:** "The look on my dad's face when he said 'we can't'" — father's pain
- "I've failed at fitness 3 times. The 4th time was different." — shame to redemption
- "My kid doesn't know I check his location every 5 minutes" — overprotective mother confession

### 800+ Strategy
This is the HIGHEST natural 800+ category. Pure emotional content maximizes E (E=10). The key: make the emotion SO specific that it feels like the viewer's own memory/experience (I=10). Safety is high because emotional vulnerability = courage, and sharing = connection (S=9-10). TS achieves 900 with protective + friendship emotions.

### Primary Formula Pool
- **F1:** TS v4 (POV Empathy 9.0), TS v18 (Sacrifice Love 8.7), TS v25 (Father Betrayal 8.7), TS v12 (Emotional Bait 8.6)
- **F2:** TS v4 (Emotional Escalation 9.2), TS v18 (J-Curve 9.3), TS v25 (Inverted U 9.0), TS v2 (Consequence Cinema 9.2)
- **F4:** TS v18 (Friendship 900), TS v2 (Protective 900), TS v4 (Identity+Emotion 810), TS v51 (Silent Friend 810), BCH v2 (Relational Bonding 810)

## Category 10: FUTURE SELF VISUALIZATION (10 videos)

**Goal:** Show the aspirational future state — who viewers become with the product. Mental simulation of the dream life.

### TG Split (10 videos)
- **Kids 14-17:** 3 videos (cool kid riding with crew, independence, speed fantasy)
- **Parents:** 3 videos (family rides, kid's confidence, "good parent" pride)
- **Fitness Adults:** 2 videos (fit/energetic future, health freedom)
- **Commuters:** 2 videos (time-rich/stress-free mornings, colleague envy)

### Concept Themes
- "A day in my life since I got the e-cycle" — kid's transformation montage
- "My kid now rides to school, tuition, and friend's house — alone" — parent pride
- "6 months later, people started asking 'what changed?'" — fitness glow-up
- "I arrive at work in 15 minutes, no sweat, no stress" — commuter dream
- "Family Sunday ride — the tradition we never planned" — family bonding vision
- "The kid who rides everywhere vs. the kid who waits for lifts" — contrast future

### 800+ Strategy
Future self content combines ASPIRATION (I=9, viewer wants this identity) with EMOTIONAL projection (E=9, they feel the future joy/pride). Safety is maximum because sharing = aspirational signaling, which is always socially rewarded (S=10). TS v48 (Bittersweet Replay 810) and TS v51 (Silent Friend 810) prove visualization content hits threshold.

### Primary Formula Pool
- **F1:** TS v4 (POV Empathy 9.0), TS v18 (Sacrifice 8.7), BCH v21 (Child Savings 8.4), BCH v54 (Night Runner 8.3)
- **F2:** TS v4 (Emotional Escalation 9.2), BCH v21 (Emotional Ascent 8.2), TS v48 (Recognition to Twist 8.0), TS v51 (Slow Burn 8.4)
- **F4:** TS v4 (Identity+Emotion 810), TS v5 (Experience Transfer 810), TS v51 (Silent Friend 810), BCH v21 (Nostalgic Aspiration 810)
