## WW1 — THE FIRST CHARGE

**Pillar:** Customer Showcase
**TG:** First-time e-cycle buyer (25-40) who's nervous about the switch from regular cycle/scooter
**Life-Event Hook:** The moment you bring something new home and plug it in for the first time — that mix of excitement and "did I make the right choice?"

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Customer plugs the charger INTO the e-cycle at the store. Camera ZOOMS into the display — 0% → charging light turns on. First spark of life.
- **Spoken:** Customer: "Idu first time charge maadthiddini. Real aa idu?" (I'm charging it for the first time. Is this even real? — Kannada)
- **On-Screen Text:** "His first e-cycle. His first charge. ⚡"
- **SFX:** Electric zap/spark sound as charger connects → building hum

### Body (3-18 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Staff walks customer through the display. "Full charge — 4 hours. That's while you sleep. Wake up — 60 km ready."
- **Sec 6-9:** Customer sits on it. Staff shows pedal assist levels. "Level 1 — you pedal normally, motor gives a gentle push. Level 3 — barely pedal, motor does the work."
- **Sec 9-12:** Customer rides it around the entrance for the first time. The FACE — that moment when the motor kicks in and they feel the assist for the first time. Pure disbelief. "Yen guru idu?!" (What is this, man?!)
- **Sec 12-15:** Customer comes back. Grinning. "How much did you pay for petrol last month?" Customer: "₹4,000." Staff: "This month? ₹15." Customer's face.
- **Sec 15-18:** Customer shakes hands with staff. Takes delivery. Rides out of the store. Staff waves. Text: "One more petrol bill — gone."

### CTA (18-22 sec)
"Your first charge is at Wattson Wheelz. DM 'WATTSON' — we'll find the right e-cycle for YOUR commute."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** First-time buyer stories are universally shareable — friends send to friends considering e-cycles
- **Comment:** "I remember my first ride — the motor kicked in and I was like WHAT 😂" — owners relate
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy charged his e-cycle for the first time and couldn't believe ₹15 replaces ₹4,000"
- **Chai:** "My friend bought an e-cycle. His petrol bill went from 4,000 to 15 rupees. Fifteen."
- **TG Filter:** Only e-cycle curious/interested people watch first-ride content. Pre-purchase mindset.
- **Tata Ace:** If they're watching someone's first e-cycle experience = they're imagining their own ✅

**Shoot notes:** EVERY customer delivery at the store is this video. Make it a TEMPLATE: camera ready, capture the first plug-in, first ride, first reaction. Staff asks the petrol question every time. The customer's real reaction IS the content. Keep camera rolling. Template this for 2-3 videos per week (every delivery = content).

---

## WW2 — THE BLIND PICK

**Pillar:** Reviews & Comparisons
**TG:** Confused buyer (25-40) overwhelmed by too many e-cycle options — "which one do I even buy?"
**Life-Event Hook:** Decision paralysis. 20 brands, 50 models, all look the same on a phone screen. Analysis paralysis.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Three e-cycles lined up side by side at the store. Staff BLINDFOLDS a person. Spins them. Points them at the three cycles. "Pick one."
- **Spoken:** "3 e-cycles. You can't see them. But after 60 seconds, you'll KNOW which one to buy."
- **On-Screen Text:** "₹30K vs ₹45K vs ₹60K. Which one should YOU buy?"
- **SFX:** Suspenseful "tick-tick-tick" timer sound

### Body (3-20 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
Blindfold OFF. Now the comparison begins — rapid-fire, one feature per 3 seconds:
- **Sec 3-5:** RANGE: "₹30K — 40 km. ₹45K — 60 km. ₹60K — 80 km." Numbers appear next to each cycle.
- **Sec 5-8:** MOTOR: Staff spins back wheel of each. "250W — city enough. 350W — hills easy. 500W — beast mode." Person feels the difference.
- **Sec 8-11:** WEIGHT: "26 kg. 22 kg. 19 kg." Person lifts each. Reaction tells the story.
- **Sec 11-14:** WARRANTY: "1 year. 2 years. 3 years." Holds up warranty cards.
- **Sec 14-17:** THE VERDICT: Staff to person: "Your commute is 12 km. Flat roads. Budget ₹40-50K. You need..." Points to middle one. "THIS one. Why pay more for features you won't use? Why pay less and compromise on range?"
- **Sec 17-20:** Person sits on the recommended one. "This one." Done. Decision made. 60 seconds.

### CTA (20-23 sec)
"Confused between e-cycles? Tell us your commute and budget — we'll pick the right one. DM 'WATTSON'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro I've been researching for 3 weeks — this reel did it in 60 seconds" — confused buyers share to other confused buyers
- **Comment:** "My budget is ₹35K, commute is 10 km — which one?" — the comments BECOME a consulting session
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy compared 3 e-cycles and told you exactly which one to buy based on your commute"
- **Chai:** "This Wattson Wheelz page — they compare 3 cycles in 60 seconds and tell you which one suits you."
- **TG Filter:** Only people actively comparing e-cycles care about price/range/feature breakdowns. Deep purchase intent.
- **Tata Ace:** Comparison shoppers ARE buyers — they've already decided to buy, just deciding WHICH ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. Line up 3 cycles at different price points. Blindfold is a fun gimmick for the first 3 seconds only — the real content is the rapid comparison. This format can be TEMPLATED — do one every 2 weeks with different cycle trios. This is a REPEATABLE format (high frequency friendly).

## WW3 — THE EMI BREAKDOWN

**Pillar:** Offers & Promotions
**TG:** Price-sensitive parent (30-44) who wants an e-cycle but thinks they can't afford it right now
**Life-Event Hook:** The "I'll buy it next month" loop that goes on for 6 months because the full price feels like a blow

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Staff writes "₹45,000" in big on a whiteboard/paper. Person RECOILS — physically steps back, hands up, "no way" gesture. Staff CROSSES OUT the number. Writes underneath: "₹1,250/month."
- **Spoken:** "₹45,000 sunke darr gaye? Ab ₹1,250 suno." (Scared of ₹45K? Now hear ₹1,250.)
- **On-Screen Text:** "₹45,000? ❌ ₹1,250/month? ✅"
- **SFX:** Red buzzer on ₹45K → green "cha-ching" on ₹1,250

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** "₹1,250 a month. That's less than your Swiggy orders." Holds up a Swiggy bill (fake/prop) next to the EMI amount. "You spent ₹1,800 on food delivery last month. But an e-cycle is 'too expensive'?"
- **Sec 6-9:** "EMI — 0% interest. 12 months. No hidden charges. No processing fee." Staff counts on fingers. Each fact = one finger.
- **Sec 9-12:** "What ₹1,250 gets you: 60 km range. ₹15 charging per month. ZERO petrol. Every month you DON'T buy, you're spending ₹3,000 on petrol that's GONE." Shows the math on whiteboard.
- **Sec 12-15:** Person walks over to the cycle. Sits on it. "So you're paying ₹1,250 to SAVE ₹3,000. You're literally MAKING money by buying this." Staff writes: "Net saving: ₹1,750/month."

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Stop spending ₹3,000 to save ₹1,250. Start today. Wattson Wheelz. DM 'WATTSON' — we'll calculate YOUR EMI."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro the EMI is less than Swiggy" — the comparison makes it immediately shareable
- **Comment:** "Wait EMI is really ₹1,250?? For an e-cycle??" — price disbelief = comments
- **Memory:** "That reel where the e-cycle EMI was less than a Swiggy bill and you actually SAVE money"
- **Chai:** "Apparently e-cycle EMI is ₹1,250 and you save ₹3,000 on petrol. So you're net positive."
- **TG Filter:** Only price-conscious buyers respond to EMI math. This is deep conversion content.
- **Tata Ace:** If someone watches EMI math to the end = they're doing mental calculations for themselves ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. Props: whiteboard or large paper, marker, fake Swiggy bill (print one). The math must be ACCURATE — get real EMI numbers from BCH finance. This format works for ANY price point — template it for ₹25K, ₹45K, ₹60K cycles.

---

## WW4 — THE HILL TEST

**Pillar:** Ride Content
**TG:** Commuter (25-40) whose route has inclines — worried the e-cycle won't handle hills
**Life-Event Hook:** Living on a hill/slope in Bangalore and dreading the ride home. Legs burn. You walk the cycle up. Embarrassing.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person GETS OFF a regular cycle at the bottom of an incline (store entrance has a slope/ramp OR use the footpath slope). Pushes it up. Huffing. Puffing. Sweat.
- **Spoken:** (Heavy breathing) "Har din... yeh slope... push karte karte... thak gaya." (Every day... this slope... pushing... I'm exhausted.)
- **On-Screen Text:** "Regular cycle on a slope: 😤🚶‍♂️ E-cycle on a slope: ?"
- **SFX:** Exhausted breathing + feet dragging → SILENCE

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** SMASH CUT. Same slope. Same person. E-cycle. Level 3 pedal assist. They ride UP the slope WITHOUT standing on pedals. Seated. Calm. Not breathing hard.
- **Sec 6-9:** Camera at the top — they arrive. Barely a drop of sweat. "Same slope. Same person. 350-watt motor. Hill mode ON." Shows the display — "HILL" mode indicator.
- **Sec 9-12:** Turns to camera: "6 months I walked this cycle up every day. Now I ride it. In 3rd gear. Sitting down." Pats the motor area.
- **Sec 12-15:** Side by side recap (editing): LEFT = pushing up sweating. RIGHT = riding up calmly. "The slope didn't change. The cycle did."

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Got hills on your route? Good. That's what the motor is for. Wattson Wheelz. DM 'WATTSON' — tell us your route, we'll recommend the right motor."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro this is literally our road" — anyone with an incline on their commute shares this
- **Comment:** "Where do you live? Is it hilly?" / "I need this for Bannerghatta road slope" — location-specific comments
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy went from pushing his cycle uphill to riding it sitting down"
- **Chai:** "Those e-cycles have a hill mode — you can ride up slopes sitting down. 350-watt motor."
- **TG Filter:** Only people with slopes on their route care about hill performance. Specific use-case buyer.
- **Tata Ace:** Hill anxiety = specific purchase objection. Solving it = immediate conversion trigger ✅

**Shoot notes:** Need ANY slope — the store entrance ramp, a nearby road incline, even a small uphill stretch on the footpath. iPhone slo-mo for the side-by-side comparison. Regular cycle pushing shot first, then e-cycle riding shot. Same person, same angle, same slope. The contrast does the work.

## WW5 — THE FAMILY SWITCH

**Pillar:** Customer Showcase
**TG:** Family (parents 30-44 with school-age kids) who bought an e-cycle and it changed their daily life
**Life-Event Hook:** The moment a family's daily routine TRANSFORMS — from stressful school runs to smooth sailing

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Family walks into the store — husband, wife, kid. The KID immediately RUNS to a specific e-cycle and SITS on it. Doesn't ask. Doesn't look at price. Just sits.
- **Spoken:** Kid turns to parents: "IDU. Bere yenu beda." (THIS ONE. Nothing else. — Kannada)
- **On-Screen Text:** "The kid chose. The parents just... followed. 😂"
- **SFX:** Record scratch when kid sits on cycle before parents even look at options

### Body (3-18 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Staff to parents: "Let me show you why your kid has good taste." Walks around the cycle. "This is [model name]. 60 km range. Pedal assist. Your school run — covered."
- **Sec 6-9:** Wife: "Safe aa?" (Is it safe?) Staff: "Disc brakes, front and rear. Speed limiter — set to 25 km/h for the kid. GPS tracking — you'll know where it is always." Wife nods — sold on safety.
- **Sec 9-12:** Husband: "EMI?" Staff: "₹[X] per month. 0% interest. Less than the auto you're paying for school runs." Husband looks at wife. Wife looks at kid. Kid is already making "vroom" sounds on the cycle.
- **Sec 12-15:** Decision happens. Handshake. Kid CHEERS. Family photo with the cycle. Staff helps kid with first ride around entrance.
- **Sec 15-18:** Family rides out. Kid in front (on the e-cycle), parents walking behind, filming on phone. Pure joy. Text: "Auto bill for school run: ₹3,000/month. Now? ₹0."

### CTA (18-22 sec)
"Your kid already knows what they want. Now you know it's safe AND affordable. Wattson Wheelz. DM 'WATTSON' — bring your family this weekend."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** Parents send to parents — "this is exactly what happened with us" / "we should do this for our kid"
- **Comment:** "My kid would do the EXACT same thing 😂" — parent bonding
- **Memory:** "That reel where the kid just sat on the cycle without asking and the parents had to catch up"
- **Chai:** "You know those e-cycles have GPS tracking and speed limiters for kids? The school auto bill disappears."
- **TG Filter:** Family content = family buyers. Every detail (safety, EMI, school run) speaks to parents.
- **Tata Ace:** Family considering an e-cycle = household purchase decision happening in real time ✅

**Shoot notes:** MUST be a real family walk-in. Template: every time a family comes to buy, shoot this format. Let the kid pick first (natural behavior). Staff asks the safety question to the wife (always the concern), EMI question to the husband (always the concern). The kid's excitement IS the content. Two angles — staff films from counter, second phone follows the family.

## WW6 — THE BRAND BATTLE

**Pillar:** Reviews & Comparisons
**TG:** Research-mode buyer (25-40) who's been watching YouTube reviews for 3 weeks and is MORE confused
**Life-Event Hook:** The "I've watched 47 comparison videos and I still don't know" paralysis

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Staff SLAMS two different brand e-cycles face-to-face at the store — front wheels almost touching. Like a boxing staredown.
- **Spoken:** "[Brand A] vs [Brand B]. ₹[X] vs ₹[Y]. Which one ACTUALLY wins? Not what YouTube said. What YOUR commute needs."
- **On-Screen Text:** "[Brand A] 🥊 vs [Brand B] — WHO WINS?"
- **SFX:** Boxing bell DING DING DING

### Body (3-18 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
5 rounds. One feature per round. Winner per round:
- **Sec 3-6:** ROUND 1 — RANGE: "[Brand A]: 50 km. [Brand B]: 65 km." Staff circles the winner. Score: 0-1.
- **Sec 6-9:** ROUND 2 — WEIGHT: "[A]: 28 kg. [B]: 22 kg." Picks up both. [B] lighter. Score: 0-2.
- **Sec 9-12:** ROUND 3 — PRICE: "[A]: ₹32K. [B]: ₹42K." [A] wins on price. Score: 1-2.
- **Sec 12-15:** ROUND 4 — WARRANTY: "[A]: 1 year. [B]: 2 years." [B] wins. Score: 1-3.
- **Sec 15-18:** ROUND 5 — AFTER SALES: "[A]: Nearest service center — Hyderabad. [B]: Right here." Points to the store floor. Final score. Winner revealed. "For YOUR commute (12 km daily, Bangalore, hills) — [B]. For a budget flat-road commute — [A]. Different needs, different winner."

### CTA (18-22 sec)
"Stop watching reviews. Come ride both. Wattson Wheelz. DM 'WATTSON' — tell us your budget and commute. We'll pick the winner."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro watch this — answers the exact question I've been asking" — comparison content is peak shareability for research-mode buyers
- **Comment:** "Do [Brand C] vs [Brand D] next!" — requests pour in, creates a content pipeline
- **Memory:** "That boxing match reel between two e-cycle brands — the one with 2-year warranty won"
- **Chai:** "I watched this comparison — [Brand B] kills [Brand A] on everything except price."
- **TG Filter:** Only active comparison shoppers watch brand-vs-brand content. Deep funnel.
- **Tata Ace:** Brand comparison = already decided to buy, just deciding which = highest-intent viewer ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. Needs two different brand cycles positioned face-to-face. Whiteboard or paper for round scores. The "boxing staredown" setup is the hook — position them like fighters. This is a TEMPLATE format — one battle per week. Different brand combos. The comments TELL you which brands to compare next.

## WW7 — THE TRADE-IN SLAM

**Pillar:** Offers & Promotions
**TG:** Existing regular cycle owner (25-40) considering upgrading to e-cycle but can't justify the full cost
**Life-Event Hook:** "I already HAVE a cycle. Why would I spend money on another one?" — the upgrade resistance

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person wheels in a dusty, old regular cycle into the store. PARKS it next to a shiny new e-cycle. The size contrast. The condition contrast. Rust vs shine.
- **Spoken:** "Idu nanna old cycle. ₹500 value irbahudu. But today? ₹5,000 off a new e-cycle." (This is my old cycle. Probably worth ₹500. But today?)
- **On-Screen Text:** "Your old cycle = ₹5,000 OFF a new e-cycle? 🤯"
- **SFX:** Dusty cycle entrance = creaky sound. Placed next to e-cycle = dramatic "upgrade" jingle

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Staff inspects the old cycle. Doesn't judge. "Koi bhi cycle chalega. Koi bhi condition. Rusty, broken, flat tire — lao." (Any cycle works. Any condition. Bring it.)
- **Sec 6-9:** Writes on a card: "Trade-in value: ₹5,000." Sticks it on the old cycle. "This cycle was sitting in your garage doing NOTHING. Now it's worth ₹5,000."
- **Sec 9-12:** "New e-cycle price: ₹[X]. After trade-in: ₹[X minus 5K]. EMI on that? ₹[amount]/month." The discount stacks visually on screen.
- **Sec 12-15:** Person hops on the new e-cycle. Old cycle in the background. "Garage space freed. ₹5,000 saved. New e-cycle earned." Rides out. Old cycle sits there — traded in.

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"That old cycle in your garage is worth ₹5,000 today. Bring it. Wattson Wheelz. DM 'WATTSON' — send a photo of your old cycle, we'll tell you the trade-in value."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro I have that exact rusty cycle in my garage — it's worth 5K apparently" — EVERY household has an old cycle
- **Comment:** "Will you accept a [specific old cycle]?" / sends photo — engagement becomes lead gen
- **Memory:** "That trade-in reel — any old cycle, any condition, ₹5,000 off"
- **Chai:** "Apparently you can take ANY old cycle to Wattson Wheelz and get ₹5,000 off a new e-cycle."
- **TG Filter:** Only people with old cycles at home (= past cyclists = future e-cyclists) care about trade-ins.
- **Tata Ace:** Trade-in interest = they already want the upgrade, just need the financial push ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. Need an old/rusty cycle — ask staff or customers if anyone has one gathering dust. The rustier/sadder looking, the funnier the contrast. Park it next to the shiniest e-cycle in the store. The visual contrast IS the comedy.

---

## WW8 — THE RAIN RIDE

**Pillar:** Ride Content
**TG:** Bangalore commuter (25-40) who thinks e-cycles only work in good weather
**Life-Event Hook:** Bangalore rains. October to December. Unpredictable. "Can I ride this in rain or will it short-circuit?"

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Water poured from a MUG directly onto the e-cycle motor/battery area. A LOT of water. Person WINCES expecting something bad. Nothing happens. The cycle just... sits there. Wet but fine.
- **Spoken:** "Mazzha bandre? E-cycle short aagalla?" (What about rain? Won't the e-cycle short out?)
- **On-Screen Text:** "Rain + E-cycle = ??? 🌧️"
- **SFX:** Water splash sound → dramatic pause (waiting for sparks) → nothing → comedic "all clear" ding

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Staff dries it off casually. "IP67 rating. Means the motor and battery are sealed. Rain, puddles, water splash — nothing gets in."
- **Sec 6-9:** "Bangalore gets 100+ rainy days a year. If your cycle can't handle rain, it can't handle Bangalore." Pats the motor. "This can."
- **Sec 9-12:** "What you SHOULD worry about: your brakes on wet roads. That's why this has disc brakes — front AND rear. Wet or dry, same stopping power." Close-up of disc brakes.
- **Sec 12-15:** Person gets on the (slightly wet) cycle. Rides around the entrance. "Wet. Working. No drama." Comes back. "Buy an e-cycle for Bangalore weather, not Delhi weather."

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Bangalore weather can't stop a good e-cycle. Wattson Wheelz. DM 'WATTSON' — ask us anything about e-cycles in rain."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro I always wondered about this — can you ride e-cycles in rain?" — common unasked question
- **Comment:** "What about puddles?" / "What IP rating should I look for?" — technical Qs drive engagement
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy poured water directly on the motor and nothing happened"
- **Chai:** "E-cycles are IP67 rated — rain doesn't affect them. Disc brakes work wet or dry."
- **TG Filter:** Only potential e-cycle buyers have this concern. Weather objection = purchase barrier being addressed.
- **Tata Ace:** Rain concern = they're evaluating practical daily use = serious buyer ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. Prop: mug of water. Pour it on the motor/battery housing area (confirm which area is safe to pour on — the IP-rated parts). The "wince and wait" reaction is the comedy. Disc brake close-up at the store. This concept removes a genuine fear that stops purchases.

## WW9 — THE DELIVERY DAY

**Pillar:** Customer Showcase
**TG:** Aspirational buyer (25-44) who wants to see REAL people getting their e-cycle
**Life-Event Hook:** Delivery day is the happiest day — the box opening, the first touch, the first ride. Pure dopamine.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Staff ROLLS OUT a brand new e-cycle from the back of the store — bubble wrap still on parts. Wheels toward the waiting customer. Customer's eyes go WIDE.
- **Spoken:** Staff: "Sir, your [model name] is ready." Customer: (no words — just steps forward)
- **On-Screen Text:** "Delivery day. The best day. 🎉"
- **SFX:** Dramatic reveal music (cinematic) as cycle emerges → cuts to upbeat when customer reacts

### Body (3-18 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Staff removes bubble wrap. Customer watches each layer come off — like unwrapping a gift. The frame revealed. Then the display. Then the wheels.
- **Sec 6-9:** Staff adjusts seat to customer's height. Shows the key. "Yehi hai aapki chaabi." (This is your key.) Hands it over. Customer holds it like it's gold.
- **Sec 9-12:** First ride. IN the store. Short loop. Customer's reaction — genuine. Staff clapping. "How does it feel?" Customer: "₹[X] ka sahi decision liya." (Best ₹[X] decision I made.)
- **Sec 12-15:** Photo moment. Customer + cycle + staff. Handshake. Customer rides OUT of the store. Into the street. Into their new life.
- **Sec 15-18:** Text overlay: Model name. Price. EMI option. Range. Warranty. All in 3 seconds. Clean. "This could be YOUR delivery day."

### CTA (18-22 sec)
"Your delivery day is one DM away. Wattson Wheelz. DM 'WATTSON' — tell us your budget. We'll find the right match."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** Delivery day content is inherently shareable — new purchase joy is universal
- **Comment:** "Which model is this?" / "EMI available?" — purchase intent comments
- **Memory:** "That delivery reel where the guy held the key like it was a car key"
- **Chai:** "My colleague bought an e-cycle from Wattson Wheelz — the delivery experience looked amazing."
- **TG Filter:** Aspirational buyers watch delivery content imagining themselves. Pre-purchase visualization.
- **Tata Ace:** If they watch a delivery video to the end = they're imagining their own delivery = buyer ✅

**Shoot notes:** TEMPLATE THIS. Every. Single. Delivery. = content. Staff rolls out cycle, camera on customer's face. Key handover. First ride. Photo. Ride-out. Same format every time. Different customer, different model. This is the HIGHEST-PERFORMING format for Wattson (customer showcase = 11L views). Shoot 2-3 per week. Never skip a delivery without filming.

## WW10 — THE CALORIE COUNTER

**Pillar:** E-Cycle Lifestyle (future influencer pivot pillar)
**TG:** Health-conscious urban adult (25-40) who thinks e-cycles are "cheating" because the motor does all the work
**Life-Event Hook:** The gym vs outdoor exercise debate — and the myth that e-cycles = zero exercise

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person SITS on an e-cycle, feet up, arms crossed. Looks lazy. Text on screen: "E-cycle = lazy?" Then SMASH CUT — same person, 30 min later, same cycle, DRENCHED in sweat. Huffing.
- **Spoken:** "E-cycle chalana = exercise nahi? Challenge accepted."
- **On-Screen Text:** "E-cycles are for lazy people? Let's test that. 💪"
- **SFX:** Lazy trombone → SMASH CUT → intense workout music

### Body (3-18 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** "Level 1 pedal assist — the motor gives 30% help. YOU do 70%." Shows the display — Level 1 selected. Starts riding.
- **Sec 6-9:** 15 minutes in. Fitness tracker/phone shows: "187 calories burned. Heart rate: 120 BPM. That's a moderate workout."
- **Sec 9-12:** 30 minutes in. "380 calories burned. 10 km covered. That's MORE than 30 minutes on a gym treadmill." Shows comparison: treadmill ~300 cal vs e-cycle Level 1 ~380 cal (you cover distance + calorie burn + outdoor fresh air).
- **Sec 12-15:** "Level 3 — the motor does 70%. That's your recovery day. Level 1 — that's your workout day. You CHOOSE your intensity." Shows the display switching between levels. "One machine. Gym AND commute."
- **Sec 15-18:** Parks the cycle. Checks fitness tracker — "380 calories before breakfast. No gym membership needed." Walks into the store. Grabs a water bottle.

### CTA (18-22 sec)
"E-cycles aren't for lazy people. They're for smart people. Wattson Wheelz. DM 'WATTSON' — try a test ride. Your legs will tell you."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Send this to everyone who calls e-cycles 'cheating'" — myth-busting content = high share
- **Comment:** "I burn more calories on my e-cycle than the gym 😤" — debate trigger
- **Memory:** "That reel where the e-cycle burned more calories than a treadmill — 380 vs 300"
- **Chai:** "E-cycles actually give you a BETTER workout than treadmill — the motor only helps 30% on level 1."
- **TG Filter:** Health-conscious + fitness-aware. People who track calories and consider e-cycles "lazy" = the EXACT people to convert.
- **Tata Ace:** If they care about exercise + e-cycles = they're health-conscious adults with purchasing power ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store entrance / footpath. Need a fitness tracker or phone with a health app showing calories. Ride for 15-30 minutes on Level 1 pedal assist and screenshot real calorie data. The sweat is real — shoot in afternoon heat for maximum effect. If the calorie numbers are accurate, this content builds incredible credibility. This is the START of the "e-cycle influencer" pivot content — lifestyle + fitness + e-cycle.
