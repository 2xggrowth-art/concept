# F1: VISUAL HOOK DECODER
## Reusable Template — Extract the Visual Hook Formula from Any Video

---

## INPUT REQUIRED
- Video analysis document (PDF/DOCX transcript with metrics, scene descriptions, timestamps)
- Creator name + Video ID
- Platform + Duration + Performance metrics (views, likes, shares, comments, saves)

---

## STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE HOOK WINDOW (0:00–0:03)

Capture exactly what happens in the first 3 seconds:
- **Visual:** What does the viewer SEE? (setting, person, objects, colors, movement, camera angle)
- **Text overlay:** Exact text, font style, color, position, duration
- **Audio:** First words spoken (exact quote in original language + translation)
- **Camera:** Movement type (handheld/tripod/gimbal), angle, framing
- **Production quality:** UGC/raw, semi-polished, studio, cinematic

---

## STEP 2: 12-POINT HOOK SCORING (1–10 with Evidence)

Score EACH dimension using ONLY observed data from the source document. No assumptions.

| # | Dimension | What to Score | Evidence Required |
|---|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Involuntary Attention Capture** | Does the first frame FORCE the brain to process it? | Describe the specific visual/audio element that triggers involuntary attention |
| 2 | **Cognitive Disruption** | Does something unexpected break the viewer's pattern? | Identify the specific disruption (contradiction, absurdity, mid-scene entry, etc.) |
| 3 | **Curiosity Gap** | Is there an unanswered question in the first 3 seconds? | State the exact gap: what the viewer DOESN'T know that they NEED to know |
| 4 | **Emotional Micro-Trigger** | Does the hook fire an emotion in <1 second? | Name the emotion + the trigger element (word, expression, situation) |
| 5 | **Platform-Native Twist** | Does this look like it BELONGS on this platform? | UGC feel, aspect ratio, native features used, trending format compliance |
| 6 | **Sound-Off Effectiveness** | Does the hook work on MUTE? | Text overlays, body language, visual narrative that carries without audio |
| 7 | **Relevance Bridge** | Does the target audience see THEMSELVES in the first frame? | Cultural markers, age signals, lifestyle cues, language choice |
| 8 | **Motion/Kinetics** | Is there movement that holds the eye? | Camera movement, subject motion, cuts, zooms, transitions |
| 9 | **Contrast/Color** | Do visual elements create separation and focus? | Color palette, contrast ratios, text vs background, lighting |
| 10 | **Repetition Resilience** | Does the hook gain value on rewatch? | Hidden details, foreshadowing, dual meanings that only land after the twist |
| 11 | **Thumbnail-Hook Alignment** | Does the thumbnail set up the hook correctly? | Match vs mismatch, intentional bait-and-pivot, expectation management |
| 12 | **Shareability Signal** | Does the hook itself contain a micro-clip worth sharing? | Quotable lines, screenshot moments, tag-a-friend triggers |

**Calculate HOOK COMPOSITE SCORE:** Average of all 12 scores.

---

## STEP 3: TRIPLE HOOK SCORES

Score each hook channel independently:

| Hook Type | What to Evaluate | Score 1-10 |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **VISUAL HOOK** | Setting, lighting, framing, subject appearance, production style | |
| **TEXT HOOK** | Overlay text content, font, color, position, readability, duration | |
| **VERBAL HOOK** | First words spoken, delivery speed, tone, language, accent, energy | |

**Identify DOMINANT HOOK:** Which channel carries the most weight?

## STEP 4: FAILURE DIAGNOSTICS — 10 Hook Failure Modes

For each failure mode, mark: **AVOIDED** / **MINOR RISK** / **PRESENT** / **CRITICAL**

| # | Failure Mode | Check |
|---|-------------|-------|
| 1 | **Generic Opening** | Does it start with "hey guys," a greeting, or a logo? |
| 2 | **Slow Build** | Does it take >3 seconds to deliver the first hook element? |
| 3 | **Context Overload** | Does it explain too much before creating intrigue? |
| 4 | **Visual Boredom** | Is the first frame visually flat, dim, or uninteresting? |
| 5 | **Sound-Dependent** | Does the hook completely fail on mute? |
| 6 | **Wrong Audience Signal** | Do visual/cultural cues repel the target audience? |
| 7 | **Clickbait Disconnect** | Does the thumbnail promise something the hook doesn't deliver? |
| 8 | **Emotion Mismatch** | Does the hook set an emotional tone the video breaks? |
| 9 | **No Stakes** | Is there nothing at risk in the first 3 seconds? |
| 10 | **Forgettable First Frame** | Would a viewer scrolling fast even register this? |

---

## STEP 5: ROLE AUDIT

Evaluate execution quality by role:

| Role | What to Evaluate | Score 1-10 |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| **Videographer** | Camera positioning, movement, location selection, lighting, framing | |
| **Editor** | Text overlay design, timing, cut precision, effect application | |
| **Creator/Performer** | Delivery energy, character work, facial expression, body language | |

---

## STEP 6: REPLICATION CHECKLIST

Generate 8-12 actionable bullet points. Each item must be:
- Specific (not "make it engaging" → "open mid-scene, drop viewer into an ongoing confrontation")
- Observable (can be checked yes/no in the final product)
- Derived from THIS video's actual technique

Format: `- [ ] [Action verb] + [specific technique] + [reference to source data]`

## QUALITY GATES

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Every score has specific evidence from source data (no "seems like" or "probably")
- [ ] All 12 dimensions scored with actual observations
- [ ] Hook window describes the FIRST 3 SECONDS only
- [ ] Replication checklist items are specific enough to execute without seeing the original video
- [ ] Failure diagnostics reference actual elements, not generic assessments
- [ ] Output is minimum 3,000 characters (anything less = insufficient depth)
