# Viral Content Formulas & Analysis Framework

---

## 1. Formula of Virality

### 1.1 The K-Factor (Viral Coefficient)

```
K = i × c
```

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|-----------|
| `K` | Viral Coefficient (K-Factor) |
| `i` | Average number of invites/shares sent per user |
| `c` | Conversion rate of each invite (% who become new users) |

- **K > 1** = Exponential viral growth (each user brings more than 1 new user)
- **K = 1** = Linear, self-sustaining growth
- **K < 1** = Growth decays without external acquisition

> True viral successes (LinkedIn, PayPal, Zoom) achieved **K = 1.3–1.5** during hyper-growth.

---

### 1.2 Adjusted Viral Coefficient (Market Saturation)

```
Adjusted K = Base K-Factor × (1 - Market Penetration %)
```

As the addressable market saturates, viral efficiency naturally declines.

---

### 1.3 Expanded Virality Formula

```
V = N × i × c × t
```

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|-----------|
| `V` | Total viral reach |
| `N` | Number of current users/viewers |
| `i` | Average invites/shares per user per time period |
| `c` | Conversion rate per invite |
| `t` | Time correction factor (lag between share and conversion) |

---

### 1.4 Content Virality Rate

```
Virality Rate = (Number of Shares / Number of Impressions) × 100
```

**Platform Benchmarks:**
| Platform | Typical Virality Rate |
|----------|----------------------|
| TikTok | 5–15% |
| Twitter/X | 0.5–2% |
| Facebook | 0.1–1% |
| Instagram | 0.05–0.5% |

---

### 1.5 The Viral Growth Equation

```
Users(t) = Users(0) × K^(t/cycle)
```

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|-----------|
| `Users(t)` | Total users at time `t` |
| `Users(0)` | Initial seed users |
| `K` | Viral coefficient |
| `t/cycle` | Number of viral cycles elapsed |

---

## 2. Hook Formula

### 2.1 The 3-Second Hook Formula

```
Hook Power = Pattern Interrupt + Curiosity Gap + Value Promise
```

Videos with **3-second retention above 65%** receive **4–7× more impressions** than those that lose viewers immediately.

---

### 2.2 The Triple Hook System (3 Hook Rule)

```
Total Hook = Visual Hook + Text Hook + Verbal Hook
```

| Layer | Timing | Function |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Visual Hook** | 0–1 second | Stops the scroll with unexpected imagery/movement |
| **Text Hook** | 0–2 seconds | Headline/overlay that triggers curiosity |
| **Verbal Hook** | 0–3 seconds | Opening words that lock commitment to watch |

> Using **all three layers simultaneously** near-guarantees a scroll-stop.

---

### 2.3 The 4P Hook Framework

```
Hook = Pattern → Promise → Proof → Pivot
```

| Step | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Pattern** | Break the viewer's autopilot scrolling | Unusual visual, bold claim |
| **Promise** | Tell them why they should stay | "This will change how you..." |
| **Proof** | Establish credibility immediately | Results, credentials, data |
| **Pivot** | Transition into the core content | "Here's exactly how..." |

---

### 2.4 Five Psychological Hook Triggers

| Trigger | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Curiosity** | Creates an information gap the brain must close |
| **Social Proof** | Leverages authority or popularity |
| **FOMO** | Suggests exclusive or time-sensitive information |
| **Controversy** | Challenges common beliefs or assumptions |
| **Immediate Value** | Promises a quick, tangible win |

---

### 2.5 Classic Copywriting Hook Formulas

**PAS (Problem–Agitate–Solution)**
```
Hook = Identify Problem → Agitate the Pain → Tease the Solution
```

**AIDA (Attention–Interest–Desire–Action)**
```
Hook = Grab Attention → Build Interest → Create Desire → Call to Action
```

**Before–After–Bridge**
```
Hook = Show Current Pain → Paint the Desired State → Bridge with Your Solution
```

---

## 3. Hook Analysis

### 3.1 Hook Rate Formula

```
Hook Rate = (3-Second Video Views / Total Impressions) × 100
```

**Benchmarks:**
| Rating | Hook Rate |
|--------|-----------|
| Weak | < 30% |
| Average | 30–45% |
| Strong | 45–65% |
| Viral-Grade | > 65% |

---

### 3.2 Hold Rate Formula

```
Hold Rate = (Complete Views / 3-Second Views) × 100
```

> Once Hook Rate exceeds 30%, shift focus to Hold Rate — it confirms whether the content delivers on the hook's promise.

---

### 3.3 Hook Effectiveness Scoring Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | Score (1–10) |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Pattern Interrupt Strength | 25% | |
| Curiosity Gap Intensity | 25% | |
| Emotional Trigger Potency | 20% | |
| Value Clarity | 15% | |
| Specificity & Concreteness | 15% | |

```
Hook Score = Σ (Weight × Score) / 10
```

---

### 3.4 Hook Type Classification

| Hook Type | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Question Hook** | Opens with a provocative question | Education, how-to |
| **Statement Hook** | Bold/contrarian claim | Opinion, controversy |
| **Story Hook** | "I was [situation] when..." | Narrative, personal brand |
| **Proof Hook** | Leads with results/evidence | Authority, conversion |
| **Visual Hook** | Unexpected imagery in first frame | Entertainment, shock value |
| **Negative Hook** | "Stop doing X" or "X is ruining Y" | Urgency, pain-point content |

---

### 3.5 Hook–Retain–Reward Framework (Alex Hormozi)

```
Content = Hook (grab attention) → Retain (build trust via insight) → Reward (deliver actionable value)
```

| Phase | Purpose | Viewer Psychology |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Hook** | Prevent scroll, earn 3 seconds | "What is this?" |
| **Retain** | Keep them through the middle | "This is interesting..." |
| **Reward** | Satisfy + motivate sharing | "That was worth it!" |

---

## 4. Emotional Journey Mapping

### 4.1 The Neurochemical Story Arc

```
Setup (Cortisol) → Climax (Dopamine) → Resolution (Oxytocin)
```

| Phase | Neurochemical | Effect on Viewer |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Setup / Tension** | Cortisol | Heightened focus and attention |
| **Climax / Conflict** | Dopamine | Emotional arousal, reward anticipation |
| **Resolution / Payoff** | Oxytocin | Empathy, connection, trust, satisfaction |

---

### 4.2 Emotional Intensity Curve

```
Intensity
  ▲
  │        ╱╲        Peak Emotion
  │       ╱  ╲
  │      ╱    ╲
  │   ╱╱╱      ╲╲
  │  ╱            ╲    Resolution
  │ ╱    Rising     ╲
  │╱                 ╲___
  └──────────────────────► Time
  Hook  Build  Climax  Payoff
```

The most viral content follows a **rising-peak-resolve** pattern with emotional intensity peaking at 60–80% of the content duration.

---

### 4.3 Emotional Valence Mapping

```
Emotional Impact = |Valence Shift| × Arousal Level × Surprise Factor
```

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|-----------|
| `Valence Shift` | Distance traveled between negative ↔ positive emotions |
| `Arousal Level` | Intensity of emotional activation (low = calm, high = excited/angry) |
| `Surprise Factor` | How unexpected the emotional shift is |

> **High-arousal emotions** (awe, anger, anxiety, excitement, amusement) are shared **significantly more** than low-arousal emotions (sadness, contentment).

---

### 4.4 The Dopamine Loop Structure

```
Curiosity Gap → Anticipation Build → Micro-Payoff → New Gap → ...
```

1. **Open a loop** — Pose a question or tease an outcome
2. **Build anticipation** — Delay the answer while adding value (dopamine rises)
3. **Deliver a micro-reward** — Partial payoff to sustain engagement
4. **Immediately open a new loop** — Prevent drop-off, restart the cycle
5. **Final payoff** — Satisfy all open loops for completion satisfaction

> The brain's largest dopamine surge comes from **anticipation**, not from the reward itself.

---

### 4.5 The Peak-End Rule (Kahneman)

```
Remembered Experience = f(Peak Emotional Moment, Final Moment)
```

Viewers judge content based on:
1. **The most intense emotional moment** (peak)
2. **How it ended** (end)

> Optimize for the strongest single moment + a satisfying ending — not average quality throughout.

---

### 4.6 Kurt Vonnegut's Story Shapes (Applied to Short-Form)

| Shape | Emotional Arc | Viral Suitability |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Man in Hole** | Good → Bad → Good | High — relatable struggle + triumph |
| **Cinderella** | Low → High → Low → High | Very High — rollercoaster creates dopamine |
| **Rags to Riches** | Steady rise from bottom | High — aspirational, shareable |
| **Tragedy** | High → Steady fall | Medium — powerful but niche |
| **Creation Story** | Nothing → Something extraordinary | High — awe-inducing |

---

## 5. Special Elements & Triggers

### 5.1 Jonah Berger's STEPPS Framework

```
Virality = Social Currency + Triggers + Emotion + Public + Practical Value + Stories
```

| Element | Core Principle | Application |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **S — Social Currency** | People share what makes them look good, smart, or in-the-know | Include insider knowledge, surprising facts, remarkable stats |
| **T — Triggers** | Environmental cues keep ideas top-of-mind | Link content to everyday situations, seasons, trending events |
| **E — Emotion** | High-arousal emotions drive sharing | Target awe, excitement, amusement, anger, or anxiety |
| **P — Public** | Visible behavior gets imitated | Make engagement/sharing visible to others |
| **P — Practical Value** | People share useful information | Include actionable tips, "news you can use" |
| **S — Stories** | Narratives carry messages further than facts | Embed your message inside a compelling story |

---

### 5.2 Cialdini's 7 Principles of Influence (Content Application)

| Principle | Viral Content Application |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Reciprocity** | Give massive free value → Audience feels compelled to share/follow |
| **Scarcity** | "Only available for 24 hours," limited info → Urgency drives immediate action |
| **Authority** | Lead with credentials, data, proof → Trust accelerates sharing |
| **Consistency** | Get micro-commitments (likes, saves) → Builds toward larger actions |
| **Liking** | Be relatable, authentic, attractive → People share from those they like |
| **Social Proof** | Show engagement numbers, testimonials → "Everyone's watching this" |
| **Unity** | Shared identity / belonging → "This is SO us" drives tribal sharing |

---

### 5.3 Cognitive Biases Leveraged in Viral Content

| Bias | How It's Exploited |
|------|--------------------|
| **Curiosity Gap** (Loewenstein) | Withhold key info → Brain must close the gap |
| **Negativity Bias** | Negative/threatening content grabs attention faster |
| **Anchoring Effect** | Lead with a shocking number/stat to frame perception |
| **Bandwagon Effect** | Show popularity metrics → "Everyone's doing it" |
| **Loss Aversion** | Frame as what they'll LOSE, not what they'll gain |
| **Availability Heuristic** | Use vivid, memorable examples → Feels more common/important |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Validate existing beliefs → Instant agreement + share |
| **Zeigarnik Effect** | Unfinished stories/incomplete information compels continued viewing |

---

### 5.4 The Five Cognitive Triggers (RAS Activation)

Content that triggers the brain's **Reticular Activating System (RAS)**:

| Trigger | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Novelty** | Unexpected visuals, sounds, or movements |
| **Personal Relevance** | POV hooks, specific pain points, "If you're a..." |
| **Curiosity Gap** | Hinting at value without revealing it |
| **Emotional Resonance** | Genuine facial expressions, dramatic reactions |
| **Authority Bias** | Data overlays, credentials, expert status |

---

## 6. Shareability Triggers

### 6.1 Shareability Score Formula

```
Shareability Score = (E × R × P × T × I) / 5
```

| Variable | Definition | Scale |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `E` | Emotional Intensity | 1–10 |
| `R` | Relatability / Personal Relevance | 1–10 |
| `P` | Practical Value | 1–10 |
| `T` | Timeliness / Trend Alignment | 1–10 |
| `I` | Identity Signal (makes sharer look good) | 1–10 |

**Score Interpretation:**
| Score | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| 8–10 | High viral potential |
| 5–7 | Moderate shareability |
| 1–4 | Low shareability — rework needed |

---

### 6.2 The Five Motivations for Sharing (NYT Research)

| Motivation | % of Sharers | Driver |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Provide value/entertainment** | 94% | "This will help/amuse my network" |
| **Define themselves to others** | 68% | "This says something about who I am" |
| **Grow & nourish relationships** | 78% | "This keeps me connected to people" |
| **Self-fulfillment** | 69% | "I feel more involved in the world" |
| **Support causes they believe in** | 84% | "This matters and others should know" |

---

### 6.3 The Share Decision Framework

```
Share Decision = Identity Alignment × Emotional Activation × Social Safety
```

A person shares when:
1. **Identity Alignment** — "Does this reflect who I am or want to be?"
2. **Emotional Activation** — "Did this make me FEEL something strongly?"
3. **Social Safety** — "Will sharing this make me look good, not bad?"

> If ANY of these three = 0, the share doesn't happen.

---

### 6.4 The Social Proof Cascade

```
Initial Shares → Visible Engagement → Social Proof → More Shares → Algorithmic Boost → Exponential Reach
```

**Cascade Stages:**
1. **Seed Phase** — First 50–100 engagements from core audience
2. **Validation Phase** — Comments/shares signal quality to the algorithm
3. **Amplification Phase** — Platform pushes to broader "For You" / Explore audiences
4. **Viral Phase** — Network effects compound; share-to-view ratio sustains growth
5. **Plateau Phase** — Market saturation; engagement normalizes

---

### 6.5 The Four Classic Share Motivations (Dichter Research)

| Motivation | % Share Driven | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Product-Involvement** | 33% | Experience so good it has to be shared |
| **Self-Involvement** | 24% | Sharing to gain attention or show exclusive access |
| **Other-Involvement** | 20% | Wanting to genuinely help others |
| **Message-Involvement** | 20% | The content itself is too wonderful or funny not to share |

---

### 6.6 Platform-Specific Shareability Factors

| Platform | Primary Share Signal | Key Multiplier |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| TikTok | Saves + Shares + Completion Rate | Sound/Trend alignment |
| Instagram | Saves + DM Shares | Aesthetic quality + Relatability |
| YouTube | Watch Time + Shares | Thumbnail + Title curiosity |
| Twitter/X | Retweets + Quote Tweets | Hot take + Timeliness |
| Facebook | Shares + Comment Threads | Emotional resonance + Group relevance |

---

## 7. Performance Analysis

### 7.1 Engagement Rate Formulas (by Platform)

**Universal Formula:**
```
Engagement Rate = (Total Interactions / Total Impressions) × 100
```

**Platform-Specific:**

| Platform | Formula | 2025–2026 Benchmark |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **TikTok** | (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) / Views × 100 | 3.70% avg |
| **Instagram** | (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) / Followers × 100 | 0.48% avg |

| **YouTube** | (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Views × 100 | 1.5–3.5% avg |

---

### 7.2 Amplification Rate

```
Amplification Rate = (Total Shares / Total Followers) × 100
```

Measures how aggressively your audience redistributes your content beyond your own reach.

---

### 7.3 Virality Rate

```
Virality Rate = (Total Shares / Total Impressions) × 100
```

The single most important metric for viral content — measures organic spread per impression.

---

### 7.4 Share-to-View Ratio

```
Share-to-View Ratio = (Total Shares / Total Views) × 100
```

**Benchmarks:**
| Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| < 0.5% | Low shareability |
| 0.5–2% | Average |
| 2–5% | High — content is resonating |
| > 5% | Viral territory |

> Shares now matter more than likes across nearly every major platform (2024–2026).

---

### 7.5 Watch Time & Retention Formulas

**Average View Duration:**
```
AVD = Total Watch Time / Total Views
```

**Average Percentage Viewed:**
```
APV = (Average View Duration / Total Video Length) × 100
```

**Retention Drop-Off Rate:**
```
Drop-Off Rate = (Views at Time X / Views at Time 0) × 100
```

---

### 7.6 Content Velocity Formula

```
Content Velocity = Total Engagements / Hours Since Published
```

Measures how fast content gains traction. High velocity in the first 1–2 hours signals algorithmic boost potential.

---

### 7.7 Growth Rate Formula

```
Growth Rate = ((New Followers - Lost Followers) / Total Followers at Start) × 100
```

---

### 7.8 ROI of Viral Content

```
Viral Content ROI = ((Revenue from Content - Cost of Production) / Cost of Production) × 100
```

---

### 7.9 Audience Sentiment Score

```
Sentiment Score = (Positive Comments - Negative Comments) / Total Comments × 100
```

| Score | Sentiment |
|-------|-----------|
| > 70% | Strongly positive |
| 40–70% | Mixed/neutral |
| < 40% | Negative — investigate |

---

## 8. Unique & Advanced Formulas

### 8.1 Viral Potential Index (VPI)

```
VPI = (Hook Rate × 0.25) + (Retention Rate × 0.25) + (Share-to-View × 0.25) + (Comment Rate × 0.15) + (Save Rate × 0.10)
```

A composite score predicting viral likelihood before content peaks.

---

### 8.2 Content Resonance Score

```
Resonance = (Avg Watch % × Engagement Rate × Share Rate) ^ (1/3)
```

The geometric mean ensures ALL three dimensions must be strong — a single weak metric tanks the score.

---

### 8.3 The Attention Retention Formula

```
Attention Retention = Σ (Pattern Breaks × Curiosity Loops × Emotional Peaks) / Content Duration
```

Measures the density of engagement-driving moments per unit of content. Higher density = better retention.

---

### 8.4 The Algorithmic Boost Formula

```
Algorithmic Score = (Early Engagement Velocity × Completion Rate × Share Signals × Session Time Contribution)
```

Platforms decide to push content based on:
| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Early Engagement Velocity** | Very High | Speed of likes/shares/comments in first 30–60 min |
| **Completion Rate** | High | % of viewers who watch to the end |
| **Share Signals** | Very High | Shares, DM forwards, cross-platform links |
| **Session Time Contribution** | High | Does this content keep users on the platform longer? |
| **Saves / Replays** | Medium | Signals deep value or rewatchability |

---

### 8.5 The 10-80-10 Content Structure Rule

```
[10% Hook] → [80% Value Delivery] → [10% CTA/Payoff]
```

| Segment | % of Content | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **First 10%** | Opening | Pattern interrupt + hook + promise |
| **Middle 80%** | Core body | Deliver on the promise with value, story, or entertainment |
| **Final 10%** | Close | Call-to-action, emotional payoff, or open loop for next content |

---

### 8.6 The Golden Ratio of Content

```
Optimal Content Mix = 40% Entertainment + 30% Education + 20% Inspiration + 10% Promotion
```

| Type | Ratio | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Entertainment** | 40% | Drives reach, shares, and new audience |
| **Education** | 30% | Builds authority, saves, and trust |
| **Inspiration** | 20% | Drives emotional engagement and loyalty |
| **Promotion** | 10% | Converts audience to customers |

---

### 8.7 The Dopamine Stacking Formula

```
Dopamine Stack = Curiosity Hit + Novelty Hit + Social Validation Hit + Achievement Hit + Anticipation Hit
```

Layer multiple dopamine triggers within a single piece of content:

| Layer | Trigger | Implementation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Curiosity** | Open with a question or incomplete information |
| 2 | **Novelty** | Introduce something unexpected or never-seen |
| 3 | **Social Validation** | Show proof others agree/engage |
| 4 | **Achievement** | Give the viewer a "now I know" moment |
| 5 | **Anticipation** | Tease what's coming next |

> More stacked dopamine triggers per second = higher retention and share probability.

---

### 8.8 The Pattern-Break Frequency Formula

```
Optimal Pattern Breaks = Content Duration (seconds) / 8–12
```

| Content Length | Recommended Pattern Breaks |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| 15 seconds | 1–2 |
| 30 seconds | 3–4 |
| 60 seconds | 5–7 |
| 3 minutes | 15–22 |
| 10 minutes | 50–75 |

**Pattern break types:** Cut change, zoom, text overlay, sound effect, B-roll switch, motion change, vocal tone shift, visual surprise.

---

### 8.9 The Audience Growth Flywheel Formula

```
Growth Flywheel = Content Quality → Engagement → Algorithmic Reach → New Followers → More Engagement → Higher Reach → ...
```

```
Flywheel Momentum = (Content Consistency × Content Quality × Audience Interaction Rate) ^ Time
```

The flywheel compounds over time — early stages feel slow, but each cycle accelerates the next.

---

### 8.10 The Viral Content Predictor (Composite)

```
Viral Probability = (Engagement Potential × 0.30) + (Trend Alignment × 0.20) + (Shareability Score × 0.30) + (Timing Score × 0.20)
```

| Component | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Engagement Potential** | Hook strength + emotional triggers + value density |
| **Trend Alignment** | Relevance to current trends, sounds, formats |
| **Shareability Score** | Identity alignment + emotional activation + social safety |
| **Timing Score** | Optimal posting time + cultural moment alignment |
