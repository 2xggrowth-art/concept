# BCH CONTENT SOP — The Complete Checklist

> **Purpose:** One document. Every rule. Every check. Every step. Use this BEFORE writing concepts, BEFORE shooting, BEFORE posting, and AFTER posting. Nothing gets published without passing through this SOP.
>
> **Built from:** Content Psychology Research (Berger, Heath, Kahneman, Cialdini), Instagram Algorithm Data (Mosseri 2025, Buffer 9.6M posts), BCH's own 6 sessions of concept feedback, and the MVP viral reel that sold 50-60 lakh.

# PHASE 1: CONCEPT CREATION

## 1A — Before You Write a Single Word

Answer these 5 questions. If you can't answer ALL 5, don't write the concept.

| # | Question | What a Good Answer Looks Like |
|---|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | **WHO is this for?** | A specific person: "14-year-old Bangalore kid whose cycle chain keeps breaking" or "38-year-old mother who checks her kid's screen time every night" — NOT "parents" or "kids" |
| 2 | **What DAILY LIFE moment does this come from?** | Something the TG has LIVED THROUGH. Chain snap. Screen time guilt. Kid asking for a ride to school. Auto fare frustration. NOT a random dramatic scenario. |
| 3 | **What will they FEEL?** | Name a HIGH-AROUSAL emotion: amusement, surprise, anxiety, pride, envy. NOT sadness, calm, or acceptance (these kill action). |
| 4 | **What will they DO after watching?** | "Send to spouse," "Save for weekend visit," "Show to kid," "DM us 'CYCLE'" — a SPECIFIC action, not "think about us." |
| 5 | **Can you describe it in ONE SENTENCE that makes someone laugh?** | If no → simplify. If yes → you have a concept. |

---

## 1B — The Concept Must Pass ALL of These

### The 14-Point Concept Checklist

| # | Principle | Test | Pass? |
|---|-----------|------|-------|
| 1 | **SIMPLE** | ONE core message only. If you removed everything except one sentence, what would it be? Does that sentence work on its own? | |
| 2 | **UNEXPECTED** | Is there a schema violation? Genre mismatch, scale mismatch, effort mismatch, or response mismatch? | |
| 3 | **CONCRETE** | Are there SPECIFIC numbers, names, places, scenarios? No abstract words like "affordable," "great," "many customers." | |
| 4 | **CREDIBLE** | Would a skeptical viewer believe this? Is there vivid detail, real social proof, or a testable claim? | |
| 5 | **EMOTIONAL** | Does this trigger a HIGH-AROUSAL emotion? Pride, guilt, amusement, anxiety, surprise — NOT sadness or calm. | |
| 6 | **STORY** | Is there a character, a tension, and a resolution? Could someone RETELL this to a friend? | |
| 7 | **SELF-PROJECTION** | Can the viewer see THEMSELVES in this? Is the person on screen similar to the TG (same age, same city, same life)? | |
| 8 | **LOSS FRAME** | Does the current state feel like a LOSS? Does the product state feel like RESTORATION? Not a gain — a restoration of what they're missing. | |
| 9 | **TG FILTER** | Would ONLY the target audience find this relevant? Or would random viewers also engage? If everyone finds it interesting, it's not targeted enough. | |
| 10 | **DAILY TRIGGER** | Is this connected to something the viewer encounters EVERY DAY? Will they think of this video the next time they see a chain snap / phone screen / auto fare? | |
| 11 | **SHARE IMPULSE** | After watching, would the viewer send this to a SPECIFIC person? Who exactly? What's the DM message? | |
| 12 | **RETENTION** | Is there a new micro-hook every 3-5 seconds? Are there open loops? Does value STACK (new info each beat, not repeated info)? | |
| 13 | **BRIDGE MOMENT** | Does the product appear as a SOLUTION to a TENSION? Not just placed in the video — it RESOLVES something. | |
| 14 | **RETELL TEST** | Can someone describe this Reel to a friend over chai? Would "BCH" or "e-cycle" naturally be part of the retelling? | |

**Scoring:** 10+/14 = ship it. 7-9/14 = rework. Below 7 = kill it.

---

## 1C — Two Content Tracks (Know Which You're Making)

| | ENTERTAINMENT Content | CONVERSION Content |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Reach, brand awareness, shares | Store visits, DMs, sales |
| **Hook type** | Genre-mismatch, absurd metaphor | TG daily-life pain point |
| **Structure** | Hook → Story → Punchline → BCH appears naturally | Hook → Value → Value → Price → CTA |
| **Example** | Kid writes breakup letter to PS5 | Kid's chain snaps → e-cycle = no chain → Rs. 999/month → "DM us CYCLE" |
| **Metrics** | Views, shares, reach | Saves, DMs, store visits |
| **Frequency** | 30% of weekly content | 70% of weekly content |
| **Length** | 15-30 seconds | 30-60 seconds |

**The user's priority is CONVERSION content.** Entertainment content builds the brand, but conversion content pays the bills.

---

## 1D — The MVP Formula (Benchmark: Sold 50-60 Lakh)

Every conversion Reel should follow this proven flow:

```
SECOND 0-3:   BOLD STATEMENT (e.g., "This is not a cycle, it's a Stream of Rad electric cycle")
SECOND 3-8:   USE CASE (Can be taken to office, school, multi-purpose)
SECOND 8-15:  PRICE (Better than online/offline — specific number, specific comparison)
SECOND 15-22: VALUE (Free gifts, free delivery, free accessories — stack the value)
SECOND 22-30: STRONG CTA (Clear, single action: "Visit BCH this Sunday" or "DM us CYCLE")
```

**Why it works:** New VALUE every 3-5 seconds. Not entertainment — INFORMATION. The viewer LEARNS something new every few seconds. High energy throughout. Specific numbers. Clear next step.

---

## 1E — The Hook Rules

### What a TG-Specific Hook IS:

A hook that comes from the target audience's DAILY LIFE EXPERIENCE. Something they've LIVED THROUGH.

| TG | Daily Life Moment → Hook |
|---|---|
| **Kids 10-16** | Chain snaps mid-ride → frustration → "There's a cycle with no chain" |
| **Kids 10-16** | Gets overtaken walking to school → envy → "What if you were the one overtaking?" |
| **Parents (mothers)** | Checking screen time at night → guilt → "What if this number was ZERO?" |
| **Parents (fathers)** | Auto fare adding up → frustration → show monthly auto cost vs EMI |
| **Budget parents** | Kid asks for something expensive → stress → "Rs. 999/month. Less than your daily chai." |

### What a Hook is NOT:

- Random dramatic scenario (heist, surveillance, crime thriller) that has nothing to do with TG's life
- Generic shock value (slapping someone, screaming, jumping)
- A format that could apply to ANY product (not TG-filtered)

### The Hook-to-Story Connection Rule:

The hook MUST connect to the story. If the hook is "chain snaps," the story must be about chain-free e-cycles. If the hook is "screen time guilt," the story must be about kids going outside. Disconnected hooks = viewer drops after 3 seconds.

---

## 1F — Value Stacking (The 3-5 Second Rule)

Every 3-5 seconds of a Reel must deliver NEW value. Not repeated value. NEW value.

**BAD (repetitive):**
- Second 0: "This cycle is amazing"
- Second 5: "This cycle is really great"
- Second 10: "You'll love this cycle"

**GOOD (stacking):**
- Second 0: "This cycle costs Rs. 7 per 100 km" (VALUE: cost)
- Second 5: "It folds in half" [demonstrates] (NEW VALUE: portability)
- Second 10: "My kid hasn't touched his phone in 2 weeks" (NEW VALUE: behavior change)
- Second 15: "EMI is less than Netflix" (NEW VALUE: affordability reframe)

**Types of value to stack:**

| Value Type | Example |
|---|---|
| Price/cost comparison | "Rs. 7 for 100 km" |
| Use case | "Takes kid to school and back on one charge" |
| Pain point solved | "No chain = no chain snap" |
| Social proof | "12 people drove from Bellari just to buy this" |
| Feature demo | "Watch it fold in half" |
| Emotional payoff | "Look at his face when he sees it" |
| Scarcity/urgency | "Only 3 left at this price" |

---

## 1G — Share/Save Triggers (Design These INTO the Script)

### Share Triggers (what makes someone DM this to a friend):

| Trigger | When to Insert | Script Example |
|---|---|---|
| **"This is literally you"** | After showing a relatable TG moment | Show a kid's chain snapping → every kid who rides sends this to their friend |
| **"Bro look at this price"** | After price reveal | "Rs. 999/month" → people forward deals to family |
| **"My friend needs this"** | After showing a problem being solved | Parent struggling with screen time → sends to other parents |
| **"This is hilarious"** | After the comedy peak | Mass Series concepts → people share movie-reference comedy |
| **Caption CTA** | End of caption | "Tag a parent who needs to see this" |

### Save Triggers (what makes someone bookmark this):

| Trigger | When to Insert | Script Example |
|---|---|---|
| **"I'll need this later"** | After specific price/offer info | "Save this — weekend offer only" |
| **"I want to show my spouse"** | After convincing use case | Product demo with EMI info |
| **"I need to compare"** | After comparison content | "E-cycle vs auto: 3-year cost" |
| **Caption CTA** | End of caption | "Save for your next BCH visit" |

---

## 1H — The Curse of Knowledge Check

Before publishing, ask: **"Would a mother in Yelahanka who has never thought about e-cycles until today understand and FEEL this in 3 seconds?"**

### Words to NEVER Use in Content:

| NEVER Say | ALWAYS Say Instead |
|---|---|
| "48V 13Ah lithium-ion battery" | "Charges overnight like your phone, lasts all weekend" |
| "350W brushless motor" | "Your kid can ride it without pedaling when they're tired" |
| "Pedal assist" | "It helps you pedal — like a push from behind" |
| "Great mileage" | "Rs. 7 for 100 km" |
| "Affordable EMI" | "Rs. 999/month — less than Netflix" |
| "Many customers" | "12 people drove from Bellari at 10 PM" |
| "Kids love it" | "My kid hasn't touched his phone in 14 days" |

# PHASE 2: BEFORE THE SHOOT

## 2A — Pre-Shoot Checklist (Print This, Tape to Camera)

- [ ] **WHO is this for?** (wrote the specific person's description)
- [ ] **WHAT will they FEEL?** (named the high-arousal emotion)
- [ ] **WHAT will they DO after watching?** (named the specific action)
- [ ] **ONE SENTENCE test passed?** (describing it makes someone laugh)
- [ ] **RETELL test passed?** (someone could describe this over chai with BCH in the retelling)
- [ ] **Shot list ready?** (every camera angle, every cut, every text overlay planned)
- [ ] **Audio decided?** (trending BGM for entertainment, original voiceover for conversion)
- [ ] **Props ready?** (simple everyday objects — no specialty items)
- [ ] **Location = BCH store + street only** (no other locations)

## 2B — During the Shoot (The Second-by-Second Rule)

| Second | What Must Happen | Viewer's Brain |
|---|---|---|
| **0-1** | VISUAL SHOCK — physical action, dramatic first frame | "What is happening?" |
| **1-3** | CONTEXT CLUE — enough to understand the situation, NOT the outcome | "Oh I see... but why?" |
| **3-5** | ESCALATION — bigger, funnier, more intense | "Oh wow" |
| **5-8** | THE TURN — unexpected twist, mismatch reveals itself | "I didn't expect that" |
| **8-12** | THE PAYOFF — open loop closes, joke lands, emotion peaks | "That was amazing" |
| **12-15** | THE RESIDUE — final frame that sticks | "I need to show someone" |

For 30-second Reels, double the pattern with a second escalation + second open loop at second 15.

## 2C — The 3 Acid Tests (After Shooting, Before Editing)

1. **The DM Test:** Would someone send this to a specific person with "bro look at this"?
2. **The Chai Test:** Would someone describe this to a friend over chai, with BCH/e-cycle in the description?
3. **The Tuesday Test:** Will someone remember this on a random Tuesday two weeks later?

If any test fails → reshoot or re-edit.

---
---

# PHASE 3: BEFORE POSTING

## 3A — Technical Specs

| Spec | Value |
|---|---|
| Resolution | 1080 x 1920 (Full HD, 9:16) |
| Frame Rate | 30 FPS |
| Format | MP4 (H.264 codec) |
| Bitrate | 10-20 Mbps |
| Audio | AAC, 128-256 kbps |
| Max file size | 4 GB |
| Watermarks | NONE (no TikTok, no CapCut logos — automatic downrank) |
| Upload | From MOBILE app (better pipeline than desktop) |

## 3B — Text Overlays

- 85% of viewers watch on MUTE. Text overlays are mandatory.
- Max 5-7 words per text block
- Bold, clean, sans-serif font — CONSISTENT across all Reels
- Position: CENTER of screen. Avoid top 15% and bottom 40%
- Always overlay: PRICE + CTA + "BCH" or "Bangalore" (for local categorization)
- Bold or color ONE key word per overlay (e.g., "**FREE** delivery")

## 3C — Caption

| Content Type | Caption Length |
|---|---|
| Entertainment | Short: under 150 characters |
| Conversion | Medium: 150-300 words |
| Educational | Long: 300-500 words |

**Structure:**
```
[Bold opening — restates the hook]
[2-3 lines of value: use case, pain point, feature]
[Price/offer with specific numbers]
[CTA — one specific action]
.
.
.
[3-5 hashtags]
```

**Rules:**
- PRIMARY keyword in the FIRST LINE (before "...more")
- Keywords: "e-cycle," "electric cycle," "kids cycle," "Bangalore," "BCH"
- On-screen text counts as keywords too — Instagram reads it for categorization

## 3D — Hashtags (2025-2026 Rules)

**Max 5 hashtags per post.** More than 5 = reduced reach.

| Type | How Many | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Niche-specific | 2-3 | #ecycle #electriccycleindia #kidscycle |
| Location | 1 | #bangalorecycling #bangalorestore |
| Trending (only if relevant) | 0-1 | #reelsviral |

## 3E — Cover Image / Thumbnail

- 1080 x 1920 (9:16), BUT grid crops to center 1080 x 1080
- Keep ALL critical text/faces within center square
- Bold headline (3-5 words) that tells viewers what the Reel is about
- Consistent brand colors across all covers

## 3F — Audio Selection

| Content Type | Audio Strategy |
|---|---|
| Mass Series (MS1-MS33) | Actual movie BGMs (trending in South India) |
| Pocket Bike (PB series) | Original audio (reactions, dialogue) + trending background |
| Conversion Reels | Original voiceover (founder/staff) — gets algorithmic preference |
| Entertainment | Audio that's STARTING to trend (catch the wave early, not after saturation) |

**Finding trending audio:** In the Reels tab, a small arrow icon next to the audio name = currently trending. Use within 3-5 days.

## 3G — Posting Time

| Day | Best Times (IST) | BCH Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Sunday | 11 AM, 7 PM | **Conversion content** — parents browsing with kids |
| Monday | 9 AM, 12 PM, 7 PM | Stories only |
| Tuesday | 9 AM, 11 AM, 7 PM | Entertainment Reel |
| Wednesday | 9 AM, 11 AM, 1 PM | **Conversion content** — best engagement day overall |
| Thursday | 10 AM, 12 PM, 8 PM | Stories only |
| Friday | 11 AM, 2 PM, 4 PM | Entertainment Reel — weekend anticipation |
| Saturday | 10 AM, 8 PM | **Conversion content** — weekend offer ("Visit BCH today") |

**Always check YOUR Instagram Insights** for your specific audience's active hours and override these general times.

## 3H — Pre-Post Final Checklist

- [ ] Video: 1080x1920, 9:16, 30 FPS, MP4, no watermarks

- [ ] Location tagged: Bharath Cycle Hub, Bangalore
- [ ] Posting time is within optimal window
- [ ] Share/save triggers designed into script at specific moments

# PHASE 4: AFTER POSTING

## 4A — First 30 Minutes (THE CRITICAL WINDOW)

This is where Wave 1 of the algorithm happens. Your Reel lives or dies here.

| Minute | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **0-1** | Post the Reel | — |
| **1-2** | Share to Instagram Story with curiosity sticker ("Watch till the end" or "Wait for the price") | Gives followers a second touchpoint; Story viewers who tap through count as views + engagement |
| **2-5** | Send via DM to 5-10 people who would GENUINELY care | Seeds DM shares — tells algorithm the content is share-worthy. DM shares are 3-5x more valuable than likes |
| **5-30** | Stay on Instagram. Reply to EVERY comment within SECONDS | Quick replies boost engagement velocity. Each reply = new comment (doubles count). Fast replies encourage MORE comments |
| **5-30** | Like and respond to DMs about the Reel | DM conversations signal engagement quality |
| **15-30** | Share Reel link to WhatsApp Status / BCH customer WhatsApp groups | External traffic. WhatsApp-to-Instagram clicks = high-intent views |

## 4B — What NOT to Do in First 30 Minutes

- **Do NOT edit the caption** — editing resets algorithmic signals
- **Do NOT delete and repost** — give it at least 24-48 hours
- **Do NOT cross-post to Facebook simultaneously** — prevents boosting
- **Do NOT leave the app** — your active engagement directly affects Wave 1
- **Do NOT post another Reel** — wait at least 4-6 hours between Reels

## 4C — 24-48 Hour Follow-Up

| Timeframe | Action |
|---|---|
| 2-4 hours | Post follow-up Story mentioning the Reel |
| 6-12 hours | If performing well, share to Stories AGAIN with a new angle |
| 24 hours | Check Insights: watch time, shares, saves, connected vs unconnected reach |
| 48 hours | If still getting engagement, share one more time in Stories |
| 1 week | Pin to grid if it's a top performer |

## 4D — Posting Frequency

| Content Type | Frequency |
|---|---|
| Reels | 3-5 per week, spaced 6+ hours apart |
| Stories | Daily, 2-4 per day every 2-3 hours during active hours |
| Feed posts (carousels) | 1-2 per week for detailed product info |

Consistency matters more than volume. Steady 4/week > erratic 7 then 1.

---
---

# PHASE 5: TRACKING & LEARNING

## 5A — Metrics That Matter (Algorithm Signal Hierarchy)

| Signal | Weight | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **DM Shares/Sends** | HEAVIEST | "Worth recommending to someone I know" — drives new audience reach |
| **Saves** | HEAVY | "I'll come back to this" — drives long-tail distribution |
| **Comments** | HEAVY | "This sparked an emotional response" — moderate expansion |
| **Watch Time / 3-sec hold** | FOUNDATIONAL | Decides if Instagram keeps showing it AT ALL |
| **Likes** | LIGHTER | "This was decent" — minor boost, maintains current distribution |

**The key insight:** 10 DM shares > 100 likes for reaching new audiences.

## 5B — Benchmarks to Hit

| Metric | Good | Great | Viral |
|---|---|---|---|
| Save rate (saves / reach) | 1-2% | 3-5% | 5%+ |
| Share rate (sends / reach) | 0.5-1% | 1-3% | 3%+ |
| 3-second hold rate | 40%+ | 60%+ | 75%+ |
| Save-to-like ratio | 1:10 | 1:5 | 1:3 |
| Share-to-like ratio | 1:20 | 1:10 | 1:5 |

**If lots of likes but few saves/shares:** Content is entertaining but not VALUABLE or RELATABLE enough.
**If lots of saves but few shares:** Content is useful but not EMOTIONAL or FUNNY enough to forward.

## 5C — Weekly Review (Every Sunday Night)

- [ ] Which Reel got the most SHARES this week? Why?
- [ ] Which Reel got the most SAVES this week? Why?
- [ ] Which Reel had the highest 3-second hold rate? Why?
- [ ] Which Reel drove the most DMs or store visits? Why?
- [ ] What patterns are emerging? (TG, hook type, length, audio)
- [ ] Update this SOP with anything new learned

---

# PHASE 6: CONTENT MIX & WEEKLY CALENDAR

## 6A — The 70/30 Split

| % | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **70%** | Conversion content (TG-specific hooks, MVP formula, product showcases, offers) | Drives store visits, DMs, sales |
| **30%** | Entertainment content (Mass Series, Pocket Bike comedy, genre-mismatch) | Builds brand, drives shares, grows followers |

## 6B — Weekly Content Calendar

| Day | Content | Type |
|---|---|---|
| **Sunday** | Conversion Reel (product showcase, offer, CTA) | Conversion |
| **Monday** | Stories only (BTS, customer testimonials, new arrivals) | Engagement |
| **Tuesday** | Entertainment Reel (Mass Series / Pocket Bike) | Entertainment |
| **Wednesday** | Conversion Reel (different product or angle) | Conversion |
| **Thursday** | Stories only (polls, questions, countdown to weekend offers) | Engagement |
| **Friday** | Entertainment Reel (new concept shoot) | Entertainment |
| **Saturday** | Conversion Reel (weekend offer: "Visit BCH today") | Conversion |

## 6C — Local Density Strategy

Your biggest growth lever isn't viral Reels — it's building a high concentration of REAL, NEARBY followers.

- Geotag "Bharath Cycle Hub, Bangalore" on EVERY post and Story
- Feature recognizable Bangalore landmarks/streets near BCH at least 1x/week
- Use Kannada phrases or local slang in some Reels
- Respond to every local commenter
- When Instagram sees Bangalore users specifically engaging, it shows you to MORE Bangalore users
- Balance: 70% local (Bangalore-targeted) + 30% broad (pan-India entertainment)

# QUICK REFERENCE — THE 6 KILL TESTS

Before ANYTHING gets published, it must pass all 6:

| # | Test | How to Check |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The One-Sentence Test** | Describe it in one sentence. Does it make someone laugh or go "wait, what?" If no → kill it. |
| 2 | **The DM Test** | Would someone send this to a SPECIFIC person? Who? What's the DM message? If no one comes to mind → kill it. |
| 3 | **The Chai Test** | Could someone describe this Reel to a friend over chai? Would "BCH" or "e-cycle" be in the retelling? If not → kill it. |
| 4 | **The Tuesday Test** | Will someone remember this on a random Tuesday 2 weeks later? What daily-life moment will trigger the memory? If nothing → kill it. |
| 5 | **The TG Filter Test** | Would ONLY the target audience care about this? Or would anyone find it mildly interesting? If it's not TG-filtered → rework the hook. |
| 6 | **The Value Stack Test** | Does the viewer get NEW information/value every 3-5 seconds? Or does the same message repeat? If repetitive → restructure. |
