### O2. THE PIGGY BANK THAT WASN'T ENOUGH — SHOT, confirmed "killer content"

A kid smashes open a piggy bank on the kitchen floor. Coins scatter everywhere. He sits on the floor counting. Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5 coins. Close-up of his small hands stacking coins. He counts everything: Rs. 2,300. His face falls. It's not enough. He stares at the pile. His father watches from the doorway, silently. Doesn't say anything. That night, the father sits with the kid. "How much do you have?" "Rs. 2,300." "I'll match what you saved. And we'll do EMI for the rest. Rs. 999 a month." They go to BCH together. The kid pays with HIS coins at the counter. Actual coins on the counter. The salesman counts them. The kid is buying his own dream.

**Why it works:** First frame is a smashed piggy bank with coins scattered on the floor — instant emotional hook. The kid counting coins that aren't enough is heartbreaking. The father matching the savings is the emotional peak. But the viral moment: a kid paying with actual coins at a store counter. That image alone is worth the share. It transforms a purchase into a lesson about earning and deserving.

**TG:** Budget Parents

### BT1 — THE HEIST — SHOT

**Context:** 12 people drove 300km from Bellari in a Tempo Traveller to buy 4 e-cycles from BCH. 10PM. All 12 on camera.

Dark parking lot, 10PM. A TT van with back doors open. 12 silhouettes loading large objects into the van. Suspicious music. Whisper voiceover: "4 targets acquired. Loading in progress. Nobody saw us." Camera slowly reveals — it's 4 e-cycles being carefully loaded. One uncle wraps a cycle in a blanket like it's a body. Cut to the driver: "Bellari, let's go. 300 kilometres. No stops." Text on screen: "They drove 300km in a TT van to buy cycles from BCH. At night. With 12 people. This is not a heist. This is trust."

### BT2 — THE SMUGGLING OPERATION — SHOT

Night vision filter. Shaky camera. 10PM. A TT van parked outside BCH. "We have 12 agents on site. The cargo: 4 units." Close-up of hands wrapping cycles, tying them down. Walkie-talkie sound: "Is the route clear?" "Clear. Bellari highway. 6 hours." Someone slams the van door shut. Dramatic pause. Then one uncle grins at the camera: "Bro, we just came to buy cycles." Record scratch. All 12 burst out laughing. "But 300km at 10PM with 12 people DOES look suspicious, no?"

## APPROVED — READY TO SHOOT

### A1. THE BREAKUP LETTER

A kid sits on his bed writing a breakup letter. Dramatic lighting. Sad music. Close-up of tears rolling down. The pen writes: "Dear PlayStation, it's not you... it's me. I found someone else." He folds the letter, places it gently on the PS5 like a goodbye. Walks out the door. There's an e-cycle waiting. He rides off into the sunset. The PS5 sits alone with the letter on top.

**Why it works:** The first frame is a crying teenager writing a breakup letter — everyone stops to see who broke his heart. The reveal that it's addressed to a gaming console is absurd comedy. The metaphor is instant: he dumped his screen life for real life. Nobody writes goodbye letters to their PlayStation.

**TG:** Kids 14-17

### A2. THE MISSING POSTER

A kid with a staple gun walks around his neighborhood putting up MISSING posters. Close-up of the poster: it has HIS OWN photo. Text reads: "MISSING: Last seen outside in 2022. If found outdoors, do not be alarmed." He staples them on poles, walls, shop shutters. People stop and stare. Confused aunties. Watchman squinting at the poster then looking at the kid. Then the kid gets on an e-cycle and rides off. He found himself.

**Why it works:** First frame is a kid stapling a MISSING poster — instant curiosity. When the viewer realizes the missing person IS the kid putting up the poster, the irony hits. It's a self-aware commentary on screen-addicted kids disappearing from the real world. The visual of a kid filing a missing report on himself is absurd enough to share.

**TG:** Kids 14-17

### A4. THE SCREEN TIME BURIAL

A kid in his backyard DIGGING a hole in the ground. Aggressive. Sweating. His parents watch from the window, confused. He goes inside, comes back with a box. Inside the box: his phone charger. His gaming headset. His tablet stylus. He DROPS each one in the hole like a coffin. Stands over it. Says nothing. Shovels dirt on top. Pats it down. Places a handmade cardboard cross: "R.I.P. My Indoor Life. 2019–2025." Wipes his hands. Walks inside. Comes back out wearing a helmet. Gets on his e-cycle. Rides away. His parents still at the window: "Should we be worried?" "No. I think he just woke up."

**Why it works:** First frame is a teenager aggressively digging a hole in the ground — the viewer's brain immediately goes dark. What is he burying? The reveal that he's burying his own screen accessories is dark-comedy gold. The handmade cross with dates is the visual punchline. Simple props: a hole, a box, a cardboard cross. Easy to shoot. The concept of a kid performing funeral rites for his indoor life is absurd, shareable, and totally BCH.

**TG:** Kids 14-17

### C3. THE 23-POINT MOM

A mother walks into BCH holding a PRINTED A4 checklist. Not on her phone — laminated, printed, 23 items. The salesman's smile fades when he sees it. She puts on reading glasses. "Item 1: Speed lock feature?" Salesman nods nervously. She marks it with a red pen. "Item 2: Maximum speed?" "25 kmph." She writes the number, not just a check. Other customers start watching. By item 15, the salesman is sweating. A small crowd gathers. She finishes all 23. Looks at the list. Every item checked. She folds the paper. Looks at her kid. "Okay." The kid EXPLODES. The crowd cheers.

**Why it works:** First frame is a mother with a laminated printed checklist interrogating a store employee like a courtroom lawyer. This is both hilarious and deeply validating for mothers. It shows BCH PASSING every safety and value test. The crowd gathering to watch makes it feel like a spectator sport. The kid's restrained explosion after 23 items of patience is the payoff. Mothers will send this to mothers.

**TG:** Mothers

**NOTE:** Script MUST include all 23 checkpoints when written.

### BT3 — THE INTERROGATION

One uncle sits on a plastic chair under a single store light. Camera tight on his face. Someone off-camera asks in a deep cop voice: "Where were you at 4 PM today?" Uncle: "Bellari." "And now?" "Bangalore." "300 kilometres. In a TT. With 12 people. At 10 PM. For FOUR CYCLES." Uncle, sweating: "...yes." Cop voice: "WHY." Uncle, cracking: "Because BCH, sir." Cut to each of the 12 getting "interrogated" one by one — same chair, same light. Each gives a more ridiculous answer. Last guy: "Sir I just came for the ride. I didn't even buy a cycle." Everyone laughs. He's the driver.

---

### BT4 — THE LINEUP

Wall outside BCH. All 12 stand in a line facing the camera — like a police lineup. Height markings drawn on the wall with chalk. Each person holds up a handwritten number card (1 through 12). A voice off-camera: "Step forward if you travelled 300 kilometres in a TT van to buy a cycle." All 12 step forward. "Step forward if you spent 40,000 for a 30,000 cycle." All 12 step forward again. "Step forward if you'd do it again." All 12 step forward. No hesitation. They're now right up against the camera. One uncle looks dead into the lens: "Guilty."

### PB6 — THE MECHANIC

Zubair rolls the pocket bike into a local mechanic's shop. "Bhai, it's not turning on." The mechanic looks at the tiny bike, confused for a second, then just pulls the kick starter — it fires up instantly. Zubair: "Oh... thanks bhai." Hops on and rides away. The mechanic watches this grown man leave on a miniature bike. Natural reaction moment — he might laugh, shake his head, or say something like "Kya scene hai yeh" to the camera. Real mechanic, real reaction, zero script needed.

---

### PB9 — THE COP

POV shot. You ARE the cop. First frame: your hand shoots out — STOP. A grown man on what looks like a children's toy skids to a halt in front of you. The thing barely reaches your knee. That's the hook — the size shock from above, looking DOWN at a full adult on a 2-foot machine.

"License?" Zubair looks up: "Sir, 50cc. No license required." Your hand reaches down and grabs the handlebar — your one hand wraps around the ENTIRE thing. You walk around the bike. Takes 2 seconds — it's that small. You squat down. Camera goes LOW. "Where's the engine?" Zubair points. You inspect. Stand back up. Take off the cap. Drop it on the seat — it covers half the bike. "How much?" Sami's voice from behind: "Sir, BCH. Bharath Cycle Hub."

---

### PB4 — THE TRAFFIC FILTER

**FRAME 1 — RAY-BAN META POV (0-3 sec)**
Zubair's eye level. Helmet on, Meta glasses underneath. The angle is absurdly low — road, tiny handlebars, traffic. He pulls up to a red signal. Two guys on scooters stop on either side. Their legs and wheels tower over the frame. One guy looks down into the glasses — real confused face captured point blank.

**FRAME 2 — THE CONVERSATION (3-12 sec)**
Still Meta POV. The guy on the right, helmet on, leans down a bit. Can't help himself.

Guy: "Bro what is this thing? How much?"

Zubair: "30K."

Guy looks at his friend on the other side. Back at Zubair.

Guy: "Bro... you could've gotten a full-size Activa for that price."

Beat.

Zubair, looking straight ahead, calm: "If I bought an Activa, you wouldn't have noticed me."

**FRAME 3 — THE HANDSHAKE (12-15 sec)**
The guy processes it. Starts nodding. Reaches his hand down. They HANDSHAKE at the signal — one guy on a scooter reaching way down, Zubair reaching way up from this tiny bike. The height difference in the handshake is the visual punchline.

**FRAME 4 — THE SPLIT (15-18 sec)**
Signal turns green. Both scooter guys ride off normal. Zubair's pocket bike SCREAMS forward — raw 2-stroke sound. Meta POV shows the road opening up as he threads through.

**FRAME 5 — SAMI (18-20 sec)**
Cut to Sami on the footpath, phone down, shaking his head: "30K for a conversation starter that works at every signal in Bangalore."
