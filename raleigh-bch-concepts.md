- **Sec 6-9:** Staff rides it around the entrance. "60 km range. That's your office commute for 3 days."

- **Sec 12-15:** Staff places receipt on the Raleigh seat. Folds arms.

### CTA (15-18 sec)

## RL2 — THE MOM'S FIRST RIDE

**Pillar:** Customer Celebration (targeting women — 38.2% of Raleigh audience)
**TG:** Women 28-40 who've been told cycling is "not for them" or are scared to try
**Life-Event Hook:** Being told you can't do something physical → actually trying it → instant joy

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Woman stands 3 feet from the Raleigh, reaches her hand out, TOUCHES the handlebar — then YANKS hand back like it burned her
- **Spoken:** "Nange cycling baralla, naan fall aagthini." (I can't cycle, I'll fall — in Kannada)

### Body (3-20 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Staff adjusts the seat height. Shows the pedal assist display. "Amma, level 1 hakkondi. Cycle 70% kelsa madthade, neenu just kuthko." (Ma'am, put level 1. Cycle does 70% of the work, you just sit.)
- **Sec 6-9:** She sits on it. Feet on ground. Takes a breath. Starts pedaling. The motor KICKS IN — her face goes from scared to SHOCKED.
- **Sec 9-12:** She rides around the store entrance. Hands still tight on handlebars. Then slowly — a SMILE. A real, unscripted smile.
- **Sec 12-16:** She completes a full loop. Husband filming from the side (genuine moment). Staff clapping. She laughs. "Ide na? Ishtu easy aa?" (This is it? This easy?)
- **Sec 16-20:** Husband walks up, she's still sitting on the cycle. "Idu nandu." (This is mine.) Husband looks at camera — helpless smile.

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** Husbands send to wives. Daughters send to mothers. Women send to friend groups. "This could be YOU."
- **Comment:** "Tag someone who says they can't cycle 👇"
- **Memory:** "That reel where the aunty touched the cycle like it was hot and then didn't want to get off"
- **Chai:** "You know those electric cycles? Apparently the cycle does 70% of the work. Even I could ride one."
- **TG Filter:** Women watching women content. Families watching family content. Exact TG.
- **Tata Ace:** Every woman/family who stops for this is a potential household e-cycle buyer ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. Need a real female customer (or staff member's wife/mother) willing to be on camera. Husband or family member films from side angle. iPhone main cam from front. This should ideally be REAL — next time a woman customer comes in, shoot this organically. Keep camera rolling. The genuine reaction IS the content.

## RL3 — THE GIFT AVALANCHE

**Pillar:** Gift & Offer Promo
**TG:** Parents who are deal-hunters (want maximum value for their spend)
**Life-Event Hook:** That "what do I get extra?" negotiation parents do at EVERY store

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)

- **Spoken:** "Yenu beda, ELLAANU free!" (Don't want anything? EVERYTHING is free!)
- **On-Screen Text:** "FREE gifts worth ₹_____"

**Shoot notes:** At store counter. Collect ALL free gift items beforehand. Stack them in arms. One take dump + one-by-one reveal. Counter should be clear at start for dramatic contrast.

---

## RL4 — THE RANGE MAP

**Pillar:** Feature Highlight
**TG:** Commuter parents worried about range anxiety ("what if it dies halfway?")
**Life-Event Hook:** The fear of any battery dying on you — phone at 5%, laptop mid-meeting, now e-cycle mid-road

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Staff UNPLUGS the charger from the Raleigh — camera zooms into the battery display showing 100%. Staff then SLAPS a printed paper map of Bangalore onto the cycle seat.
- **Spoken:** "Yelahanka to Jayanagar. And BACK. One charge."
- **On-Screen Text:** "60 km. ONE charge. Where can YOU go? 🗺️"
- **SFX:** GPS "ping" sound effect as locations are mentioned

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Staff traces a route on the map with finger. "Yelahanka to Hebbal — 6 km. Still 90% battery." Point at display.
- **Sec 6-9:** "Hebbal to MG Road — 12 km. Still 75%." Pats the cycle. "Not even halfway."

- **TG Filter:** Range anxiety = ONLY people considering e-cycles. Random viewers don't care about km/charge.
- **Tata Ace:** If someone watches a range demo to the end, they're calculating their own commute = buyer ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. Props: printed map of Bangalore (A3 size), marker pen to trace route. Raleigh on display with battery showing 100%. Staff traces route and points to display throughout.

## RL5 — THE BIRTHDAY HANDOVER

**Pillar:** Customer Celebration
**TG:** Parents planning a birthday gift for their kid (ages 10-16)
**Life-Event Hook:** The stress of finding the PERFECT birthday gift — useful, exciting, memorable

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Kid walks into the store. Parent's HANDS cover kid's eyes from behind. Kid is being GUIDED blindly through the store. Steps are hesitant.
- **Spoken:** Kid: "Yaake kannu muchidiyaa? Elli hogthiddivi?" (Why are you covering my eyes? Where are we going? — Kannada)
- **On-Screen Text:** "His 13th birthday. He has NO idea. 🎂"
- **SFX:** Slow heartbeat building in intensity

### Body (3-18 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-5:** Parent positions kid in front of the Raleigh (we see the cycle, kid doesn't). Big red bow on the handlebar. Parent looks at camera and smiles.
- **Sec 5-7:** Hands come OFF. Kid opens eyes. FREEZE FRAME on kid's face — the EXACT moment of realization. 0.5 second pause.
- **Sec 7-10:** Kid's reaction — whatever it is (scream, tears, jumping, frozen shock). Don't script this. The REAL reaction IS the content. Cut between kid's face and the cycle.
- **Sec 10-13:** Kid runs to the cycle. Touches it. Sits on it. Turns the display on. "Idu nandaa?!" (This is mine?!) Parent nods.
- **Sec 13-16:** First ride around the store entrance/street. Kid riding, pure joy on face. Parent watches, filming on their phone. Staff clapping.
- **Sec 16-18:** Kid comes back, parks the cycle, HUGS parent. Text overlay: "Every Raleigh birthday at BCH includes: FREE cake 🎂 | FREE gift wrap 🎁 | FREE first-ride video 📹"

### CTA (18-22 sec)
"Your kid's birthday coming up? We'll plan the whole surprise. Cake, setup, video — on us. Raleigh x BCH, Yelahanka. DM 'RALEIGH' + the date. 2 days notice."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** Parents send to other parents — "look at this! We should do this for [kid's name]." The birthday itself becomes the share trigger.
- **Comment:** "When's your kid's birthday? 🎂" — parents WILL comment with dates
- **Memory:** "That reel where the kid's eyes were covered and they revealed a Raleigh — his face was priceless"
- **Chai:** "You know that Raleigh cycle shop gives free cake and video for birthday purchases? My friend did it for her son."
- **TG Filter:** Only parents of kids approaching birthday age stop for birthday content. Exact TG.
- **Tata Ace:** Birthday = specific purchase intent. If they watch, they're already considering ✅

**Shoot notes:** This MUST be a real customer's kid's birthday. Keep camera ready. Parent coordinates with BCH 2 days before. The reaction cannot be scripted — shoot 2 angles (iPhone front, second phone wide). Buy a big red bow (Rs. 50). Template: use this exact setup for EVERY birthday purchase going forward.

## RL6 — THE 365-DAY CALL

**Pillar:** Trust Signal
**TG:** Skeptical buyer (30-45) who's been burned by cheap electronics breaking after 6 months
**Life-Event Hook:** Every "premium" product that degraded after 6 months — phone batteries, headphones, appliances

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Staff DIALS a phone number on speakerphone in front of the camera. Phone ringing. Rings once. Twice. Customer PICKS UP.
- **Spoken:** Staff: "Sir, aapka Raleigh buy karte waqt exactly 1 saal ho gaya. Kaise chal raha hai? Sach bolo." (Sir, it's been exactly 1 year since you bought. How's it running? Tell the truth.)
- **On-Screen Text:** "365 days later. Same cycle? 🤔"
- **SFX:** Phone ring tone → speakerphone click → ambient sound of customer's environment

### Body (3-18 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Customer (on speakerphone, camera on the phone): "Battery abhi bhi 55 km deta hai. Pehle din jaisa." (Battery still gives 55 km. Same as day one.)
- **Sec 6-9:** Staff: "Koi problem aaya? Kuch repair?" Customer: "ZERO. Ek rupee kharcha nahi kiya." (Zero. Haven't spent a single rupee.)
- **Sec 9-12:** Staff: "Proof bhejo." Customer sends a photo/video over WhatsApp (show the phone receiving it). Staff holds phone to camera — customer's cycle still in great condition. Clean, maintained.
- **Sec 12-15:** Cut to the SAME MODEL on display at the store. Staff stands next to it. "Yehi model. 2-year warranty. 365 days, zero complaints."
- **Sec 15-18:** Staff holds up the warranty card next to the display cycle. "Agar kuch hota — motor, battery, frame — hum fix karte hain. FREE." (If anything happens — motor, battery, frame — we fix it. FREE.)

### CTA (18-21 sec)
"Don't take our word for it. Ask anyone who owns a Raleigh. Raleigh x BCH, Yelahanka. DM 'RALEIGH' — we'll connect you with real owners."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Send this to someone who says e-cycles don't last" — the proof removes the #1 objection
- **Comment:** "Raleigh owners — drop how long you've had yours 👇" — creates a social proof comment section
- **Memory:** "That reel where they called a customer after 1 year and the battery was still perfect"
- **Chai:** "Apparently Raleigh batteries still give 55 km after one full year. And 2-year warranty means if anything breaks, free repair."
- **TG Filter:** Only people with durability concerns care about 1-year followups. Buyers.
- **Tata Ace:** If someone watches a warranty/durability reel to the end = they're evaluating a purchase ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. CALL A REAL CUSTOMER who bought 6-12 months ago. Put on speakerphone. Screen record the WhatsApp photo they send. Must be GENUINE — scripted phone calls feel fake instantly. Prep the customer beforehand: "We're making a reel, can we call you and ask how the cycle is?" Keep it raw.

---

## RL7 — THE WIFE APPROVAL

**Pillar:** Feature Highlight (targeting couples)
**TG:** Married men 30-40 who need wife's buy-in, AND the wives themselves
**Life-Event Hook:** The classic "I want to buy this" → wife: "Pehle mujhe convince karo" (convince me first) negotiation

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Wife CROSSES ARMS and physically BLOCKS the store entrance. Stands like a bouncer. Legs planted wide. Husband stands outside, hands folded, pleading face.
- **Spoken:** Wife: "Nange convince maadi. Aagidre naan olgbannu." (Convince me first. Then I'll come in. — Kannada)
- **On-Screen Text:** "Wife said NO. 🚫 Can he convince her?"
- **SFX:** Dramatic courtroom "DUN DUN" (Law & Order style)

### Body (3-18 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
Husband starts listing features. Wife's body language is the scoreboard:
- **Sec 3-5:** "Weight — 22 kg. You can lift it." Wife: arms still crossed. Eyebrow raised. "So?"
- **Sec 5-8:** "Range — 60 km. School run + grocery + office. One charge." Arms UNCROSS slightly. "Hmmm."
- **Sec 8-11:** "Charging — 4 hours. Plug at night, ready by morning." She steps to ONE side. Door half open.
- **Sec 11-14:** "EMI — Rs. [X] per month. Less than your Swiggy bill." She takes ONE step inside. "Continue."
- **Sec 14-16:** "2-year warranty. And ALL accessories — FREE." She walks FULLY inside.
- **Sec 16-18:** Plot twist: She walks past ALL the cycles, picks a COLOR, turns to staff — "IDU. Pack maadi." (THIS ONE. Pack it.) Husband's jaw drops. She was going to buy all along. She just wanted to hear the features first.

### CTA (18-22 sec)
"Smart wives ask smart questions. Bring yours — we'll answer them all. Raleigh x BCH, Yelahanka. DM 'RALEIGH' — both of you."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** Husbands SEND to wives ("this is literally us"). Wives send to husbands ("this is what you should've done"). Works BOTH directions.
- **Comment:** "Who needs more convincing — you or your partner? 😂" — guaranteed comment war
- **Memory:** "That reel where the wife blocked the door and the husband had to pitch features to get in — and she ended up buying it herself"
- **Chai:** "You know, that Raleigh EMI is less than Swiggy bill apparently. And the wife reel was hilarious."
- **TG Filter:** Only couples/married people relate to the "spouse approval" dynamic. Exact buyer unit.
- **Tata Ace:** Couples watching couple content = household purchase decision in progress ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store entrance. Need a couple — can be staff members' family or a real customer couple. The comedy is in the wife's body language progression (arms crossed → uncrossing → stepping aside → walking in → taking over). Husband's features must be spoken naturally, not read. Wife's reactions must feel real — don't over-act.

---

## RL8 — THE REPAIR BILL ZERO

**Pillar:** Trust Signal
**TG:** Skeptical parents who've bought cheap e-cycles/electronics that broke and cost a fortune to repair
**Life-Event Hook:** That gut-punch moment when the repair bill is MORE than the original product was worth

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Staff STACKS repair bills (printed paper) on the counter — one after another — the pile GROWS. Each bill is from a DIFFERENT cheap e-cycle brand repair.
- **Spoken:** "₹3,500 — motor. ₹4,200 — battery. ₹2,800 — controller. ₹1,500 — display. One year mein Rs. 12,000 ka repair."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Cheap e-cycle: ₹12,000 repair bill in 1 year 💸"
- **SFX:** Cash register "ching" with each bill added, speeding up

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Staff SWEEPS the entire pile of repair bills off the counter in one dramatic arm motion. Counter is now EMPTY. "Ab Raleigh ka repair bill dekhna hai?" (Want to see Raleigh's repair bill?)
- **Sec 6-9:** Staff places ONE paper on the clean counter. Camera zooms in. The paper says: "₹0." Blank. "2-year warranty. Motor, battery, frame — everything covered."
- **Sec 9-12:** "In 2 years, if ANYTHING fails — we replace it. Free. You don't go to some random shop. You come HERE." Points to the store. "We're right here in Yelahanka."
- **Sec 12-15:** Staff places the warranty card NEXT to the "₹0" paper. Side by side: Cheap brands' ₹12,000 vs Raleigh's ₹0. "Cheap is expensive. Raleigh is FREE."

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Spend once, ride for years. Not spend less, repair forever. Raleigh x BCH, Yelahanka. DM 'RALEIGH' — ask about our warranty."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Send this to someone who bought a cheap e-cycle and is now paying for repairs"
- **Comment:** "Anyone else spent more on repairs than the cycle itself? 👇" — pain bonding
- **Memory:** "That reel where they stacked repair bills and Raleigh's was just ₹0"
- **Chai:** "My friend spent 12K repairing his cheap e-cycle. Raleigh gives 2-year free warranty apparently."
- **TG Filter:** Only e-cycle buyers/owners care about repair costs. Non-buyers scroll past.
- **Tata Ace:** Repair anxiety = active purchase consideration ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store counter. Props: 5-6 printed "repair bills" (fake, with different brand names and amounts), one paper with "₹0" written large, Raleigh warranty card. The counter sweep is the dramatic moment — practice the arm motion for one clean take.

---

## RL9 — THE FIRST KEY

**Pillar:** Customer Celebration (targeting teens — 13.7% audience)
**TG:** Teens 13-17 getting their first "vehicle" + parents giving the gift
**Life-Event Hook:** The FIRST TIME you get something that gives you independence — your own key, your own ride, your own freedom

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Close-up of a parent's hand OPENING slowly — revealing a small key/fob sitting in the palm. A teenager's hand REACHES for it — hesitates — TREMBLES slightly.
- **Spoken:** Teen whispers: "Seriously...?" Parent says nothing. Just nods.
- **On-Screen Text:** "His first KEY. 🔑 His first freedom."
- **SFX:** Soft cinematic piano note — single key strike — as teen's fingers touch the key

### Body (3-18 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Teen takes the key. Looks up. Sees the Raleigh parked in front of them with a bow. Eyes go WIDE. Mouth opens but no words come out.
- **Sec 6-9:** First touch. Hand runs along the handlebar. Sits on it. Feet barely touch the ground. Puts the key in. Display lights up. Every number, every light = REAL to them.
- **Sec 9-12:** First ride. Out the store entrance. Down the footpath. Not fast — slow, savoring it. Camera from behind — the back of a kid riding into their own independence.
- **Sec 12-15:** Parent watches from the store entrance. Arms folded. Proud face. Maybe slightly emotional. Staff stands next to parent. "First vehicle?" Parent nods. "Best gift you could give."
- **Sec 15-18:** Teen rides BACK. Stops. Gets off. Doesn't say anything — just HUGS the parent. Text overlay: "Not just a cycle. His first ride to college. His first ride to freedom."

### CTA (18-22 sec)
"Their first vehicle should be the right one. 2-year warranty. Safe. Smart. Raleigh x BCH, Yelahanka. DM 'RALEIGH'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** Teens send to parents as a HINT ("this could be my birthday gift"). Parents send to other parents ("great idea for your kid"). Emotional content = high share.
- **Comment:** "Remember YOUR first vehicle? What was it? 👇" — nostalgia trigger
- **Memory:** "That reel where the kid's hand was shaking when he got his first cycle key"
- **Chai:** "Did you see that Raleigh reel? The kid getting his first key — I almost cried."
- **TG Filter:** Parents + teens. The emotional weight of "first vehicle" only hits people in that life stage.
- **Tata Ace:** Emotional family content → parents make purchase decisions based on how they FEEL about their kid's reaction ✅

**Shoot notes:** MUST be a real teen customer moment. Coordinate with parent beforehand. Keep it raw and genuine. Two camera angles — iPhone close-up on hands/face, second phone wide shot. The trembling hand and the hug cannot be faked. If the moment happens, DON'T stop rolling. The genuine emotion IS the content.

## RL10 — THE SIDE-BY-SIDE

**Pillar:** Raleigh vs Others (comparison)
**TG:** Budget-conscious parent (30-44) comparing e-cycles online, confused by options
**Life-Event Hook:** The "why should I pay more for Raleigh when there are ₹18K e-cycles on Amazon?" calculation

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Two cycles side by side at the store. Staff PICKS UP the generic/cheaper one with one hand — it WOBBLES and CREAKS. Sets it down — tinny sound. Then picks up the Raleigh — SOLID. Sets it down — deep, quality THUD.
- **Spoken:** "₹18,000 ka e-cycle. ₹[Raleigh price] ka Raleigh. Same same? DEKHO." (Same? LOOK.)
- **On-Screen Text:** "₹18K vs ₹___. Same thing? 🤔"
- **SFX:** Creaky/tinny sound on cheap → solid bass thud on Raleigh. The SOUND tells the story.

### Body (3-18 sec — value every 3 sec)
Side-by-side comparison. One feature per 3 seconds. Staff stands between both cycles:
- **Sec 3-5:** BUILD — shakes the cheap one (rattles). Shakes the Raleigh (solid, nothing moves). "Feel the difference."
- **Sec 5-8:** BATTERY — opens the battery compartment of both. "Generic cells vs Raleigh branded cells." Close-up of both.
- **Sec 8-11:** MOTOR — turns both on. Cheap one = noisy whirr. Raleigh = near-silent. "Listen."
- **Sec 11-14:** WARRANTY — holds up two cards. "3 months... vs 2 YEARS." Drops the 3-month card on the floor.
- **Sec 14-16:** RANGE — "25 km... vs 60 km." Numbers appear on screen side by side.
- **Sec 16-18:** AFTER-SALES — "Good luck finding their service center. Ours? You're standing in it." Points around the store.

### CTA (18-22 sec)
"Cheap is expensive when it breaks in 6 months. Raleigh x BCH, Yelahanka. Walk in — we'll show you both. DM 'RALEIGH'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Send this to anyone about to order a cheap e-cycle off Amazon" — people LOVE saving friends from bad purchases
- **Comment:** "Have you bought the cheap option and regretted it? 👇" — regret stories flood in
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy shook both cycles and the cheap one rattled like a toy"
- **Chai:** "Apparently those Amazon e-cycles give 25 km range and 3-month warranty. Raleigh gives 60 km and 2 years."
- **TG Filter:** ONLY people comparing e-cycles care about side-by-side features. Pre-purchase mindset.
- **Tata Ace:** Comparison shoppers ARE buyers — they're deciding WHICH to buy, not WHETHER to buy ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. Need two e-cycles side by side — Raleigh + a lower-end model (BCH likely stocks budget options). The physical demonstrations (shake, sound, motor noise) must be REAL — no faking. If the cheap one doesn't creak, don't fake it. Honest comparison builds more trust than exaggerated differences.
