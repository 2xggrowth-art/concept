# PART 2: THE TARGET AUDIENCE

## The Segments

| Segment | Share | Who They Are |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Kids | 75% | 14-17 years, 88% male, international schools, introverts, status-driven |
| Parents | 20% | The REAL decision makers. Father 78%, Mother 22%. Ages 30s-40s. |
| Adults | 15% | Office commute (50%), fitness (40%), business (5%) |
| Grey | 10% | Elderly, women, business users |

## Kid Psychology

**The one thing they want: SOCIAL STATUS. Nothing else.**

- 52% motivation: "for myself" vs 48% "for others to see" (nearly equal — status is half the purchase)
- They want to be "THE COOL GUY — socially praised kid — basically THE WINNER"
- Faster than friends (25 kmph matters)
- Drifting/throttle abilities
- Group status (above all friends)
- Products they ask for by name: Doodle, EMotorad, Foldable, "Dhoni cycle"
- Celebrity tie-ins work on this segment

## Parent Psychology

### What Makes Parents Buy (Ranked)

1. **Get kid OFF screens** (40%) — Gaming addiction fear
2. Health/fitness (20%)
3. Independence (20%)
4. Social skills (10%)
5. Confidence (10%)

### What BREAKS Parents Into Buying

| Trigger | % |
|---------|---|
| Seeing kid sad one too many times | 40% |
| Birthday (makes it "justified") | 30% |
| Exhaustion from begging | 30% |

### Mother's REAL Fear (Not What She Says)

| Fear | % |
|------|---|
| "Looking like a bad mother who let something happen" | 50% |
| "Losing control" | 40% |
| "Death/injury" (what she SAYS) | 10% |

The mother's biggest fear is NOT her child getting hurt. It's OTHER PEOPLE thinking she's a bad mother. This changes everything about how you frame safety content.

### Father's Focus

Price. That's it. Father cares about the number.

### Parent Objections (Hardest to Easiest)

1. **"He won't use much"** — HARDEST to overcome. 70% drop-off after 3 months proves them right.
2. **"He rides less than 1km"** — Usage concern
3. **"Roads not safe"** — EASIEST. Vent the fear, acknowledge it, show speed lock at 25 kmph.

### Who Wins the Decision?

Son wins most. Then father. Mother rarely gets final say on WHICH cycle, but she has veto power on WHETHER to buy at all.

## Financial Segments

| Segment | % | Income | Behavior |
|---------|---|--------|----------|
| Rich | 37% | Rs. 1L+/month | Don't negotiate. 20-min decisions. Guilt-free. |
| Middle | 28% | Rs. 50K-1L/month | 10-min negotiations. Need NEED + VALUE perception. |
| Budget | 35% | <Rs. 20K/month | EMI critical or cash only. |

### EMI Reality

- 23% buy on EMI
- **Rs. 999/month** = the magic number (everyone can say yes to this)
- **30% can't qualify for EMI** — this is a MASSIVE revenue leak (18% total loss)
- 40% of EMI-failed customers can be recovered with alternative financing

# PART 3: THE PURCHASE JOURNEY

## Discovery → Visit → Buy → Retain

### How They Find BCH

| Channel | % |
|---------|---|
| YouTube | 40% |
| Instagram | 30% |
| Google | 15% |
| Word of mouth | 15% |

88% say **"we saw you online"** when they walk in.

### The 7-Day Window

**65% must visit within 7 days of discovering BCH or they forget entirely.** This is the critical conversion window. Content must create urgency within this window.

### At The Store

- **85% buy on first visit** (30-min average decision time)
- Kid's excitement during test ride drives parent's decision
- Other customers buying at the same time influences undecided customers (BIG social proof moment)
- **1 client video = 4 more clients** (proven multiplier)

### After Purchase (The Problem)

- **70% usage drops after 3 months** — the cycle becomes a wall decoration
- Only **20% "Gold" customers** integrate it into daily life (short distance <3km, daily commute)
- E-cycle retains interest **300% longer** than normal cycle
- No reactivation system exists (massive opportunity)

## Trust Hierarchy (What Customers Believe)

1. Friends who bought (most trusted)
2. BCH content
3. Google reviews
4. Other online content
5. In-store experience

---

# PART 4: CONTENT STRATEGY

## The Content DNA

### What BCH Content Must Do

1. **Entertain first.** Social media is for entertainment. Product appears silently but hits the subconscious.
2. **Stop the scroll in 0-3 seconds.** Physical action or visual confusion. If it needs 10 seconds to land, it's dead.
3. **Show TG daily life, EXAGGERATED.** Show what the TG THINKS about situations but can't act on.
4. **The concept IS the hook.** Don't design a separate "visual hook" and attach a story. The IDEA itself must stop the scroll.
5. **One sentence = you laugh.** If describing the concept in one sentence doesn't make someone laugh, it's not a concept.
6. **Genre mismatch = the formula.** Everyday situation + absurd dramatic genre = comedy. The more serious the genre (crime, legal, medical, military), the funnier it is applied to mundane family/store life.
7. **Zero brand stats.** No "25 years." No "1 lakh customers." No hook scores. No formula labels. Pure entertainment. BCH appears naturally or not at all.

### What Works (Proven)

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Physical action in first 2 sec | Scroll stop — the BODY does something dramatic before the MOUTH says anything |
| Genre mismatch | Crime-thriller energy on innocent situations = gold |
| Simple props, unexpected use | Breakup letter to a PS5 = zero budget, maximum virality |
| Raw/authentic over polished | UGC energy wins |
| Kannada (casual street) | ALWAYS wins over English or Hindi |
| Real customer reactions | Genuine faces > scripted comedy |
| Innocent thing that LOOKS suspicious | Bellari TT proved this — crime energy on wholesome situations |
| Kid + parent dynamics | 75% of audience relates |

### What Does NOT Work

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Dialogue-first concepts | Viewer scrolls before anyone speaks |
| Home setup skits | Can't shoot there. Store + street only. |
| Phone screens / text chats | Viewer is ON a phone — another phone screen doesn't interrupt |
| Interview/reporter style | Every store does this |
| Celebration/sentimental energy | Not edgy enough |
| Complex multi-scene storytelling | Too slow for Reels |
| Subtle emotions (no physical hook) | Gets auto-rejected |
| Repeated themes of already-shot content | Feels recycled |
| "Designed hooks" with attached stories | The IDEA itself must be the hook |
| BCH stats, hook scores, formula labels | Makes it feel like marketing, not entertainment |

### Content Specs

| Spec | Rule |
|------|------|
| Language | Casual street Kannada (ALWAYS wins) |
| Tone | Excited, energetic, then authoritative |
| Hook | Entertainment in first 6 seconds (surprise, shock, curiosity) |
| Length | <30 sec Instagram, <3 min YouTube |
| Style | Raw/authentic > polished. "You" language. |
| Timing | Post after 6 PM (peak consumption) |
| CTA | "Call now" outperforms all others (vs DM, social, links) |

### Video Performance Lessons

**What converted (MVP Video — 172K likes, 113K shares):**
- Celebrity endorsement (MVP Kannada, 500K followers)
- Trust transfer > creative brilliance
- Specific: "Rs. 15K electric cycle" (CONCRETE number)
- Anti-curiosity: No tease, just CTA
- Call-to-visit: 12%. Visit-to-purchase: 33%.
- **Result: ~10K calls, 1,200 store visits, 400 sales**

**What went viral but didn't convert (Budget Electric — 4.8M views):**
- "All India Delivery" reached unqualified traffic
- Vague pricing "under budget" (forgettable)
- Multiple offers = decision paralysis
- **Result: 0.004% conversion (10x worse than MVP)**

**The rule:** 1 local view with purchase intent > 1,000 national views with zero intent.

# PART 5: THE SHOOTING CONSTRAINTS

| Constraint | Rule |
|------------|------|
| **E-cycle content** | BCH store interior + entrance + immediate footpath/street. No home setups. No parks/malls/markets. |
| **Pocket Bike content** | Any public place in Bangalore — streets, petrol bunks, mechanic shops, traffic signals, cafes. The bike goes everywhere. |
| **Ray-Ban Meta content** | Real-world locations where the pocket bike creates genuine confusion. Hidden camera — people don't know they're being filmed. |
| **Talent (e-cycle)** | BCH staff + real walk-in customers |
| **Talent (pocket bike)** | Zubair (main) + Sami (supporting) |
| **Equipment** | Phone camera. Ray-Ban Meta glasses for POV series. No special gear. |

- Product appears naturally at the end or not at all

### Consideration Series (C1-C10)
- Trust-building. Answer "which one?" and "is it worth it?"
- Emotional narratives, father/mother stories
- Every concept MUST have a distinct visual hook in first 2 seconds

### Offer Series (O1-O10)
- Drive purchase action
- Visual hooks SEPARATE from the offer itself
- Direct-to-camera founder works IF opening line is emotionally charged
- Party poppers / cloth reveals / physical celebration = good hooks
- Kid interactions at store = proven gold

### Reddy Anna Series (R1-R20 + X1)
- Character: Full gold chain, rings, South Indian rich-dad energy
- 20 concepts featuring Reddy at/around BCH
- Mass entry, swagger, humor, real interactions
- Character may be deprioritized per Great Reset

### Bellari TT Series (BT1-BT4)
- Real event: 12 people drove 300km in a Tempo Traveller to buy 4 cycles
- Crime-thriller treatment on a wholesome family purchase
- **Key lesson:** When there's a REAL situation, make the innocent thing LOOK suspicious/criminal

## Pocket Bike Series

### Zubair & Sami Series (PB1-PB50)
- **Characters:** Zubair (main rider) + Sami (supporting, commentary)
- **The bike IS the content.** 23kg, 62cm seat height, 50CC, 2-stroke pull-start. A grown man on a toddler-sized machine.
- **The comedy:** Size mismatch, confused strangers, absurd situations
- **Locations:** Anywhere in Bangalore — petrol bunks, mechanic shops, signals, cafes, elevators, parking lots
- **Content pillars:** Size reveal, sound vs size, cost comparisons, real reactions, physical comedy

### Ray-Ban Meta POV Series (RM1-RM20)
- **The glasses are the camera.** Ray-Ban Meta = hidden camera. Real interactions. Real people. Zero clue they're being filmed.
- **Dual angle:** Meta POV (main) + Sami wide shot (backup/reveal)
- **Every script:** A real-world location where the pocket bike creates genuine confusion
- **The candid reactions ARE the content** — can't script those faces
- **Locations:** Drive-through, toll booth, puncture shop, apartment gate, dhaba, helmet shop, parking lots, school zone, chai tapri, weighbridge, Uber backseat, fruit vendor, car mechanic, etc.
- **Key characters:** Zubair (rider, wearing the glasses) + Sami (filming from distance)

## Free Gift Weekend Series (FG1-FG12)

### The Strategy
- BCH gives a FREE gift with every weekend e-cycle purchase
- Walk-in only. BCH assigns the gift. No booking.
- ~38 items: massager guns, OTGs, headphones, soundbar, boxing gloves, mixer grinder, cooker warmer, etc.
- CTA: **"Every weekend. Just walk in."**

### The Content Approach
- Entertainment first. The gift is the SURPRISE PUNCHLINE, never the lead.
- Shot entirely at BCH store + footpath
- The mismatch of random items at a cycle store IS the comedy
- Every concept has a 0-3 sec physical/visual hook

---

# PART 7: THE CHARACTERS

## Zubair (Main — Pocket Bike + Ray-Ban Meta)
- Rides the pocket bike. Wears the Ray-Ban Meta glasses.
- The straight man. Calm, unbothered. The world reacts to him, not the other way around.
- His size on the tiny bike is the visual comedy.

## Sami (Supporting — Pocket Bike + Ray-Ban Meta)
- Films from a distance (wide shot/backup angle)
- Provides commentary, punchlines, and reaction shots
- The narrator. Sami closes the Reel with the insight.

## Reddy Anna (E-Cycle Series — May Be Deprioritized)
- Full gold chain, rings on every finger, South Indian wealthy energy
- Swagger. Mass entry. Larger than life.
- Interacts with BCH store, staff, customers, random people
- 20 dedicated concepts (R1-R20) + bonus (X1)

# PART 9: THE GLOBAL RULES

These rules apply to ALL content. Non-negotiable.

1. **Entertainment first, product second.** Social media is for entertainment. The concept ENTERTAINS. Product appears silently but hits the subconscious.

2. **The concept IS the hook.** Don't design separate "visual hooks" and attach stories. The IDEA itself must stop the scroll. If describing the concept in one sentence doesn't make someone laugh, it's not a concept.

3. **Genre mismatch = the formula.** Everyday situation + absurd dramatic genre = comedy. The more serious the genre (crime, legal, medical, military), the funnier it is applied to mundane family life.

4. **0-3 seconds or death.** Physical action or visual confusion in the first 3 seconds. No slow builds. No dialogue openings. The BODY does something dramatic before the MOUTH says anything.

5. **Simple + clever > complex + impressive.** Best concepts use EVERYDAY objects in unexpected ways. Avoid specialty items. A breakup letter to a PS5 needs zero budget but is more viral than a bedroom museum with 20 props.

6. **Zero brand stats in concepts.** No "25 years." No "1 lakh customers." No hook scores. No formula labels. Pure entertainment. BCH appears naturally at the end or not at all.

7. **Show TG daily life, EXAGGERATED.** Show the way the TG THINKS about situations but cannot act on because of society/environment. Take their real feelings and externalize them dramatically.

8. **When shooting real customer moments, treat the innocent thing as suspicious/criminal.** Crime-thriller energy >>> sentimental/celebratory energy.

9. **Phone screens, text chats, subtle emotions are NOT hooks.** The viewer is ON a phone — showing another phone screen doesn't interrupt. Physical, real-world, dramatic action interrupts.

10. **Shooting locations for e-cycle content = BCH store + footpath.** No home setups. No other locations. Pocket bike content can go anywhere public.

11. **Avoid repeated themes.** Don't repackage already-shot content in a different context. Add more daily life events and exaggerate them.

12. **Production feasibility matters.** "Easy to make AND easy to relate" is the sweet spot. Don't assume "full production" means unlimited props.

13. **Kannada always wins.** Casual street Kannada. Not formal. Not English.

14. **Rejected formats:** News reporter interviews, math breakdowns, wedding/celebration vibes, emotional testimonials, reality show structures. These are what EVERY store does.

# PART 11: KEY NUMBERS

| Metric | Number | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|---------------|

| 7 days | Critical visit window | 65% forget BCH if they don't visit within 7 days |
| 85% | Buy on first visit | 30-min average decision. The test ride closes. |
| 70% | Usage drop after 3 months | The biggest retention problem. Cycle becomes wall decoration. |
| 20% | Gold customers | Only segment that integrates into daily life |
| Rs. 999/month | Magic EMI number | The price point everyone says yes to |
| 30% | Can't qualify for EMI | 18% total revenue leak |

| 52% vs 48% | Status motivation split | Half buy for themselves, half buy for others to see |
| 50% | Mother's real fear | "Looking like a bad mother" > actual safety concern |
| 40% | Screen addiction trigger | #1 reason parents buy |
| <30 sec | Instagram Reel length | Anything longer = viewer drop-off |
| After 6 PM | Best post time | Peak consumption window |
| Rs. 12 CR | Annual revenue | Current baseline |
| Rs. 5.2-6.18 CR/month | Target with 3-tier offers | +44-72% increase potential |

---

# PART 12: THE OPPORTUNITIES

## What's Working (Keep Doing)

- 88% store conversion (world-class)
- Content-driven premium pricing (Rs. 2K premium and customers still buy)
- 1 video = 4 clients pipeline
- Test ride magic (5-minute decision trigger in-store)
- 25-year legacy + market dominance
- Kannada content advantage (no real competitor doing this)

## What's Broken (Fix These)

| Problem | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| 70% drop after 3 months | Customers prove parents right ("told you he won't use it") | BCH Riders Club, community rides, area-wise groups |
| 30% EMI rejection | 18% revenue leak | Alternative financing, Freedom Starter tier |
| No win-back campaigns | Churned customers ignored | Reactivation SMS/WhatsApp sequence |
| No outcome-based guarantees | Missing despite <1% refund rate | 90-day screen-free guarantee |
| No paid ads | Rs. 2-5L/month budget untapped | Local Bangalore targeting only |
| Vague offer positioning | Selling "cycles" not "transformation" | 3-tier named packages with promises |
