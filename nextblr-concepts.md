## NB1 — THE NIGHT REVEAL

**Pillar:** Product Hero Showcase
**TG:** Urban Bangalore male 25-35, style-conscious, wants something that LOOKS as good as it rides
**Life-Event Hook:** Bangalore evenings — the city transforms at night. Lights, traffic, energy. Your ride should match.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** COMPLETE DARKNESS. A single LED headlight turns ON — blinding into the camera. Slowly, the outline of a cycle emerges from the dark. Frame by frame, light reveals the body.
- **Spoken:** Dead silence for 2 seconds. Then one word: "Beast."
- **On-Screen Text:** Nothing for 2 seconds. Then: "Midnight. Bangalore. One machine."
- **SFX:** Deep bass hum that builds as the light comes on — like a machine powering up

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Light fully reveals the cycle. Slow pan from front wheel to back. Every curve, every detail. Night lighting makes it cinematic. Reflections on the frame.
- **Sec 6-9:** Close-up of the display turning on — numbers lighting up. Range. Speed. Battery. The tech comes alive.
- **Sec 9-12:** Person gets on. Rides into the street. Camera follows from behind — tail light glowing red in the dark. Bangalore street lights streak past.
- **Sec 12-15:** Drone-style shot (or elevated phone angle from above) — the cycle cutting through an empty Bangalore road at night. One rider. One city. Text overlay: model name + starting price.

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Built for Bangalore after dark. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT' — or find us this weekend."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro look at this cycle" — the cinematic reveal makes it shareable as a VISUAL, not just a product
- **Comment:** "What cycle is this?!" / "Price?" — curiosity-driven comments
- **Memory:** "That cycle reel shot at night where the headlight came on and it looked like a bike ad"
- **Chai:** "Have you seen this cycling page? The night shots look insane."
- **TG Filter:** Style-conscious urban Bangalore crowd. The cinematic night aesthetic self-selects the right TG.
- **Tata Ace:** If they're watching a product reveal at night in Bangalore = they live here and want this ✅

**Shoot notes:** MUST shoot after dark. BCH store entrance or nearby street. iPhone 15 Pro Max handles low light well. Start in complete darkness — turn headlight ON as camera rolls. Slo-mo for the light reveal. Use the street/footpath outside for the riding shot. Golden hour or full dark both work.

## NB2 — THE SILK BOARD ESCAPE

**Pillar:** Urban Commute Content
**TG:** Bangalore commuter 25-40 who's DIED inside at Silk Board junction
**Life-Event Hook:** Every Bangalorean has a Silk Board trauma. The junction where time goes to die.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Phone screen showing Google Maps — Silk Board Junction — BRIGHT RED traffic. ETA: 1 hour 45 min. Hand SLAPS the phone face-down on a table.
- **Spoken:** "Silk Board. 1 hour 45 minutes. For 8 kilometers."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Bangalore traffic ruined your evening. Again."
- **SFX:** Car horn chaos (2 seconds of real Bangalore traffic audio) → sudden SILENCE

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Cut to silence. Person walks to their AOK/e-cycle parked at the store entrance. Puts on helmet. Gets on. No cars. No traffic. No honking.
- **Sec 6-9:** Riding footage on an actual Bangalore road (or footpath outside store). Breezing past. Text overlay: "Same 8 km. Same route."
- **Sec 9-12:** Phone held up showing Google Maps — "18 minutes." Then shows the cycle display: battery still at 85%. "18 minutes. ₹3 of electricity. Zero road rage."
- **Sec 12-15:** Parks at destination (could be store entrance from the other direction). Takes off helmet. Checks watch. Smiles. Text overlay: "1 hour 27 minutes. That's what you saved today."

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Next time you're stuck at Silk Board, remember — you chose this. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT' — your commute is about to change."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** EVERY Bangalorean will share a Silk Board pain reel — it's a shared city trauma
- **Comment:** "What's your worst Silk Board experience?" — unlimited engagement
- **Memory:** "That reel where the cycle did Silk Board in 18 minutes while cars took 1 hour 45"
- **Chai:** "Did you know you can cycle from Silk Board to HSR in 18 minutes? My car takes 2 hours sometimes."
- **TG Filter:** Only Bangalore commuters know Silk Board pain. Non-Bangaloreans scroll past. PERFECT local filter.
- **Tata Ace:** If someone watches a commute comparison to the end = they're calculating their own route ✅

**Shoot notes:** Google Maps screenshot of Silk Board traffic is easy (take a real one during peak hours). Riding footage can be shot on the footpath/street outside the store. The before (phone) vs after (cycle) comparison is all editing. No external location needed.

## NB3 — THE COFFEE RUN

**Pillar:** Lifestyle Integration
**TG:** Urban Bangalore 25-35, café culture crowd, weekend riders
**Life-Event Hook:** The Bangalore weekend coffee run — Koramangala to Indiranagar, Third Wave to Blue Tokai. Everyone does it.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** A coffee cup sits on a table. Hand picks it up — takes a SIP — puts it down HARD. Camera pulls back to reveal the person is sitting ON the e-cycle, coffee in one hand, handlebar in the other.
- **Spoken:** "Saturday morning. Oru coffee. Oru ride." (One coffee. One ride.)
- **On-Screen Text:** "Saturday 7 AM. Bangalore woke up. Did you?"
- **SFX:** Coffee pour sound → bicycle bell ding

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Riding through morning Bangalore (or just outside the store — early morning, empty streets). Light traffic. Morning light. Peaceful. Text: "No Uber surge. No parking hunt. No petrol queue."
- **Sec 6-9:** Arrives at a "coffee spot" (this can be the store counter with a coffee cup staged). Parks. Locks. "Total commute cost: ₹2. Total time: 12 minutes. Total stress: 0."
- **Sec 9-12:** Sits with coffee. Cycle parked behind them. The shot is LIFESTYLE — person, coffee, cycle. Not a product shot — a LIFE shot. "This is what Bangalore mornings should feel like."
- **Sec 12-15:** Gets back on the cycle. Rides off. Camera stays. Morning light catches the frame. Beautiful static shot of an empty road.

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Your Saturday mornings don't have to start with traffic. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** Bangalore café crowd shares lifestyle content within their circles — aesthetic + relatable
- **Comment:** "Your go-to Bangalore coffee spot? ☕" — people LOVE sharing their coffee opinions
- **Memory:** "That chill Saturday morning cycle + coffee reel — I want that life"
- **Chai:** "I saw this page — this guy cycles to his coffee spot every Saturday. Costs him Rs. 2."
- **TG Filter:** Urban Bangalore lifestyle crowd self-selects for this content. Not mass. Not everyone. The RIGHT 25-35 urban crowd.
- **Tata Ace:** Lifestyle aspiration content → these people HAVE the spending power for e-cycles ✅

**Shoot notes:** Shoot early morning (6-7 AM) at store entrance or nearby street when it's empty. Prop: one coffee cup. The morning light does all the work. Keep it calm, not energetic — this page's energy is DIFFERENT from BCH Main.

## NB4 — THE WEIGHT TEST

**Pillar:** Product Hero Showcase
**TG:** First-time e-cycle buyer (25-40) worried about e-cycles being heavy and bulky
**Life-Event Hook:** "E-cycles are heavy" — the #1 misconception that stops people from buying

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person stands next to the cycle. LIFTS the entire e-cycle with ONE HAND — holds it up. The cycle HANGS in the air. One hand. No struggle.
- **Spoken:** "Everyone says e-cycles are heavy. Really?"
- **On-Screen Text:** "Too heavy? Watch this. ⚖️"
- **SFX:** Comic "whoooosh" lift sound → dramatic pause while cycle hangs in air

### Body (3-12 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-5:** Still holding it with one hand. "22 kilos. That's 2 buckets of water." Puts it down gently. Solid thud.
- **Sec 5-8:** "Your gym dumbbell is 15 kg. This is 22. With a motor, a battery, and 60 km of range INSIDE it." Pats the frame.
- **Sec 8-10:** Person casually lifts it UP a single step (store entrance step). "Apartment stairs? Elevator? Car boot? Not a problem."
- **Sec 10-12:** Sets it down. Turns it on. Display lights up. "Light enough to carry. Smart enough to carry YOU."

### CTA (12-15 sec)
"Come lift it yourself. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro this guy lifted the e-cycle with one hand" — the visual itself is shareable
- **Comment:** "No way that's 22 kg" / "Which model?" — disbelief = comments
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy held the entire e-cycle up with one hand"
- **Chai:** "Those new e-cycles are only 22 kg apparently. A guy lifted it with one hand."
- **TG Filter:** Only people considering e-cycles care about weight. Addresses the #1 objection.
- **Tata Ace:** Weight concern = purchase barrier. Removing it = unblocking the sale ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. Need someone strong enough to hold the cycle up with one hand for 3-4 seconds. If the model is 22 kg, this is doable for most fit men. If not one hand, try two hands overhead — still dramatic. The step at the store entrance works for the "carrying upstairs" demo.

## NB5 — THE PARKING MATH

**Pillar:** Urban Commute Content
**TG:** Car/bike owner (28-40) who spends Rs. 3000-5000/month on parking in Bangalore
**Life-Event Hook:** Finding parking in Bangalore — the 20-minute circling, the Rs. 100/day charges, the frustration

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person stands next to a PARKED CAR. Opens the wallet. Pulls out a Rs. 100 note. STICKS IT on the windshield (like a parking fine). Then another Rs. 100. And another. The windshield fills with notes.
- **Spoken:** "₹100. Har din. Parking ke liye. Mahine ka ₹3,000 sirf KHADE REHNE ke liye." (₹100 every day. Just for STANDING STILL.)
- **On-Screen Text:** "₹3,000/month. Just to PARK. 🅿️"
- **SFX:** Paper slapping glass sound with each note → cash register total

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Cut to person PARKING the e-cycle against a pole (or store entrance). Locks it. "Parking cost: ₹0. Time to find parking: 0 seconds."
- **Sec 6-9:** "₹3,000 in parking × 12 months = ₹36,000 a year. Just. To. Park." Numbers appear on screen.
- **Sec 9-12:** Stands next to the parked cycle. "This cycle COSTS less than 2 years of your car parking." Let that sink in. "And it takes you places. Your parking just... stands there."
- **Sec 12-15:** Gets on the cycle. Rides past the parked car with notes on the windshield. Doesn't look back.

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Stop paying rent for your car. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT' — let's do the math on YOUR commute."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro I literally pay 3K a month parking — send this to every car owner in Bangalore"
- **Comment:** "How much do YOU spend on parking? 👇" — people love ranting about Bangalore parking
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy stuck cash on a car windshield — parking costs more than the cycle"
- **Chai:** "Apparently 2 years of car parking costs more than an entire e-cycle. We're idiots."
- **TG Filter:** Only car/bike owners in Bangalore understand parking pain. Perfect urban commuter filter.
- **Tata Ace:** Anyone watching parking math = they're paying for parking = they have money for an e-cycle ✅

**Shoot notes:** Need access to a parked car — can use a customer's car if available (conditional per shoot constraints) OR shoot just the dashboard/windshield angle without needing the full car. Rs. 100 notes as props (5-6 notes, real or printed). Cycle parking shot at store entrance.

## NB6 — THE SUNDAY ROUTE

**Pillar:** Lifestyle Integration
**TG:** Weekend fitness/outdoor enthusiast 25-40, Bangalore
**Life-Event Hook:** The Bangalore weekend dilemma — gym membership you don't use, Strava guilt, saying "I'll start this weekend" every Friday

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Phone shows a STRAVA app with 0 km this week. ZERO. The shame. Person THROWS the phone on a sofa (or counter). Grabs a helmet instead.
- **Spoken:** "3 months of gym membership. Zero visits. But THIS..."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Gym: ₹15,000/year. Total visits: 4. 😑"
- **SFX:** Buzzer sound (like a game show wrong answer) on the Strava zero → upbeat music kicks in

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Person on the e-cycle, riding. Morning light. Bangalore road. "Sunday morning. 15 km ride. Pedal assist level 2 — you still pedal, it just helps."
- **Sec 6-9:** Phone mounted on handlebar showing LIVE stats — distance, calories, speed. "8 km in. 180 calories burned. Not even breathing hard."
- **Sec 9-12:** Stops at a scenic point (store entrance in morning light works). Takes a sip of water. "Your gym membership sits unused. This goes wherever YOU go."
- **Sec 12-15:** Back on the cycle. Riding. "15 km done. 350 calories. That's your daily Starbucks, burned before 8 AM." Shows Strava app now: 15 km completed.

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"The best workout is the one you actually DO. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Send this to someone with a gym membership they never use" — EVERYONE knows that person (or IS that person)
- **Comment:** "Be honest — how many times did you go to the gym this month? 😂" — vulnerability comments
- **Memory:** "That reel where the guy's Strava was at 0 and he burned 350 calories on a cycle before 8 AM"
- **Chai:** "You know you can burn 350 calories cycling 15 km on those e-cycles? That's better than my gym."
- **TG Filter:** Fitness-curious urban crowd with gym guilt. Not random fitness — CYCLING-specific fitness.
- **Tata Ace:** Gym-guilt + fitness-interest = health-conscious buyers with spending power ✅

**Shoot notes:** Early morning shoot. Phone showing Strava zero (screenshot or stage it). Riding footage on footpath/street outside store. Phone mounted on handlebar for stats shot (use a mount or tape). Morning light is essential for the lifestyle feel.

## NB7 — THE FOLD

**Pillar:** Product Hero Showcase
**TG:** Apartment-dwelling Bangalorean (25-40) with zero storage space
**Life-Event Hook:** "Where will I KEEP it?" — the #2 objection after weight. Bangalore apartments are SMALL.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person FOLDS the e-cycle in one motion — frame collapses, handlebars tuck — it goes from full cycle to half-size in 2 seconds. THUD as it stands folded.
- **Spoken:** "1BHK mein cycle rakhne ki jagah nahi? WATCH."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Your apartment is 500 sqft. Where does the cycle go?"
- **SFX:** Mechanical click-click-LOCK sound as it folds — satisfying engineering sound

### Body (3-12 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-5:** Folded cycle stands next to common objects for size comparison. "Smaller than your suitcase. Fits behind your sofa. Fits in your car boot."
- **Sec 5-8:** Person PICKS IT UP folded and walks with it through a doorway (store entrance). "Take it inside your office. Take it inside the lift. Take it inside the train."
- **Sec 8-10:** UNFOLD — one motion — full cycle again. Ready to ride. "3 seconds to fold. 3 seconds to unfold."
- **Sec 10-12:** Person rides away on the now-unfolded cycle. "500 sqft apartment? Not a problem."

### CTA (12-15 sec)
"Small space, big ride. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT' — come fold it yourself."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "Bro this cycle FOLDS" — the folding mechanism is inherently shareable/satisfying
- **Comment:** "I NEED this" / "Price?" — product curiosity
- **Memory:** "That cycle that folds in half and fits behind a sofa"
- **Chai:** "There's this folding e-cycle — fits in a 1BHK. My friend showed me the reel."
- **TG Filter:** Only apartment dwellers with space issues care about folding. Urban Bangalore = apartments.
- **Tata Ace:** Storage objection = purchase blocker. Removing it = unblocking the sale ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store. ONLY works if there's a foldable model in stock. If not, skip this concept and replace. The fold-unfold must be smooth — practice before filming. The satisfying click sound can be amplified in editing. Compare folded size to a suitcase or box at the store for reference.

## NB8 — THE LAST MILE

**Pillar:** Urban Commute Content
**TG:** Metro commuter (25-40) dealing with the "last mile" problem — metro station to office/home
**Life-Event Hook:** Bangalore Metro ends. But your destination is 3 km from the station. Auto? Rs. 100. Walk? 30 minutes. Every. Single. Day.

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Person stands OUTSIDE (imagine metro station exit — actually shot at store entrance). Holds up a hand to flag an auto. Auto drives PAST. Another drives past. Third one stops — "100 rupees." Person's jaw drops.
- **Spoken:** "Metro se utre. 3 km baaki. Auto — ₹100. Har din. ₹2,600 mahine ka. SIRF last mile."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Metro ✅ Last 3 km? 💀 ₹100/day."
- **SFX:** Auto meter beeping sound → comedic fail horn

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** Person walks to their e-cycle (folded, leaning against wall). UNFOLDS it. 3 seconds. Gets on.
- **Sec 6-9:** Rides the "last mile." Breezing past. "3 km. 8 minutes. ₹0.50 of electricity."
- **Sec 9-12:** Parks at "destination" (other end of store entrance). "₹100 vs ₹0.50. Every day. For 3 km. You do that math for a year."
- **Sec 12-15:** Text overlay stacks up: "Auto: ₹100/day = ₹2,600/month = ₹31,200/year" vs "E-cycle: ₹0.50/day = ₹15/month = ₹180/year." Difference: "₹31,020 saved."

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"The metro takes you 90% there. This takes you the rest. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** Every metro commuter shares this — "this is literally our problem"
- **Comment:** "How much do YOU spend on last-mile autos? 👇" — everyone has a number
- **Memory:** "That reel where the auto was Rs. 100 for 3 km and the cycle was Rs. 0.50"
- **Chai:** "Apparently metro commuters spend Rs. 31,000 a year on autos for just the last 3 km. A folding cycle solves it."
- **TG Filter:** ONLY metro users in Bangalore. Hyper-local. Hyper-specific problem.
- **Tata Ace:** Last-mile frustration = daily pain = ready to buy a solution ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store entrance. The "auto" interaction can be staged with a staff member or skipped (just show the hand wave + text of ₹100). The e-cycle unfolding + riding is at the store. Math overlay is editing. No external location needed.

---

## NB9 — THE BEFORE & AFTER

**Pillar:** Dramatic Storytelling
**TG:** Stressed Bangalore professional (25-40) who's lost their energy/joy to commute
**Life-Event Hook:** The version of yourself BEFORE commute stress ate your soul vs AFTER you found a better way

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** Split screen or sequential: LEFT/FIRST = person SLUMPED in a chair, dark circles, messy hair, phone buzzing, traffic sounds in background. DEAD inside. RIGHT/THEN = SAME person, standing with cycle, helmet on, clean look, morning light, ALIVE.
- **Spoken:** "Same person. Same Bangalore. Different commute."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Before: Dead by 9 AM. After: Alive by 7 AM."
- **SFX:** LEFT = gloomy piano + traffic noise. RIGHT = upbeat music + birds chirping

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
Side-by-side or alternating shots of the SAME morning:
- **Sec 3-6:** BEFORE: Sitting in traffic (person in chair, phone showing red map). AFTER: Riding through empty morning road.
- **Sec 6-9:** BEFORE: "Late again" text on phone. AFTER: Arrives early. Parks. Checks watch — 7:15 AM.
- **Sec 9-12:** BEFORE: Rs. 5000/month (petrol + parking + toll). AFTER: Rs. 400/month (charging only). Numbers side by side.
- **Sec 12-15:** BEFORE: Stares at ceiling fan, exhausted, 9 PM. AFTER: Out riding with friends, 7 PM, laughing. "Same city. Same 24 hours. Different machine."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "This is literally me on the left" — people share relatable before/after content
- **Comment:** "Are you the before or the after? 👇"
- **Memory:** "That before/after commute reel — the dead-inside car guy vs the cycling guy"
- **Chai:** "You know, those e-cycle commuters save 5K a month AND get to work earlier? We're doing it wrong."
- **TG Filter:** Stressed commuters. The "dead by 9 AM" line filters for office-going Bangaloreans.
- **Tata Ace:** If someone sees themselves in "before" = they want the "after" = buyer ✅

**Shoot notes:** All at store. "Before" shots = person slumped in a store chair, shot with flat/dull lighting. "After" shots = same person, different clothes, with cycle, morning light (shoot early or use bright light). Split screen/alternating is all editing. Same person, two looks.

## NB10 — THE BANGALORE BUILD

**Pillar:** AOK Brand Building
**TG:** Curious viewer who discovers the page and asks "what even IS this brand?"
**Life-Event Hook:** International cycles built for European roads ≠ what Bangalore roads need

### 4 Hook Layers (0-3 sec)
- **Visual:** A cycle wheel HITS a pothole — HARD. Dramatic slo-mo of the impact. The wheel bounces. The frame shudders. Dust flies.
- **Spoken:** "European cycle. Bangalore road. Good luck."
- **On-Screen Text:** "Built for Amsterdam? Or built for Bangalore? 🕳️"
- **SFX:** Loud CRUNCH of wheel hitting pothole → dramatic bass rumble

### Body (3-15 sec — value every 3-5 sec)
- **Sec 3-6:** "Most e-cycles are designed for flat European roads. Smooth. Clean. Perfect." Show a flat, clean road image. "That's NOT Bangalore."
- **Sec 6-9:** "Bangalore has potholes, speed bumps, auto-cut traffic, construction everywhere." Quick cuts of typical road challenges (can shoot right outside the store — every Bangalore road has these).
- **Sec 9-12:** Show the AOK cycle. Close-up: thick tires, suspension, sturdy frame. "This was built for THIS. Thicker tires. Better suspension. Frame that takes a beating."
- **Sec 12-15:** Person rides over a bump/pothole (store entrance step or nearby road). Slo-mo. The suspension absorbs it. Zero drama. "Not built for Amsterdam. Built for Bangalore."

### CTA (15-18 sec)
"Your roads are brutal. Your cycle shouldn't be fragile. Next.BLR. DM 'NEXT'."

### Kill Tests
- **Share:** "FINALLY someone made a cycle for Bangalore roads" — local pride trigger
- **Comment:** "Bangalore roads need TANKS not cycles 😂" — people love roasting Bangalore roads
- **Memory:** "That reel about the cycle built for Bangalore potholes, not European roads"
- **Chai:** "There's this brand — AOK — apparently built specifically for Indian roads, not imported from Europe."
- **TG Filter:** Only Bangalore residents who RIDE on these roads daily care about suspension and build quality.
- **Tata Ace:** Road concern = practical buyer = someone who actually rides and will purchase ✅

**Shoot notes:** At store entrance / footpath outside. The pothole/bump can be the entrance step or a real crack in the road. Slo-mo on iPhone for the impact absorption shot. AOK tire/frame close-ups at the store. The "European road vs Bangalore road" contrast is all editing (text + quick cuts).
