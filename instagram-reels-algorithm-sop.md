## PART 1: HOW THE INSTAGRAM REELS ALGORITHM WORKS (2025-2026)

### 1.1 — The Three Confirmed Ranking Factors (Mosseri, January 2025)

Adam Mosseri publicly confirmed these as THE three signals that determine whether a Reel gets pushed:

| Rank | Signal | What It Measures | Impact |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **#1** | **Watch Time** | How long people watch your Reel (total + relative retention) | Most important for INITIAL distribution. First 3 seconds are critical — users decide stay-or-scroll in ~1.7 seconds |
| **#2** | **Sends Per Reach (DM Shares)** | How many people share your Reel via DM to friends | Most powerful signal for reaching NEW audiences (unconnected reach). **3-5x more valuable than likes** for discovery |
| **#3** | **Likes Per Reach** | What % of viewers liked the Reel | Most important for reaching EXISTING followers (connected reach) |

**The hierarchy in plain language:**
- Watch time decides if Instagram keeps showing it
- DM shares decide if Instagram shows it to STRANGERS
- Likes decide if Instagram shows it to YOUR FOLLOWERS

### 1.2 — The Distribution Wave System

Instagram does NOT push your Reel to everyone at once. It works in waves:

**Wave 1 (0-60 minutes): Initial Test**
- Your Reel is shown to a small test group — a mix of your followers AND non-followers
- Instagram measures: watch time, 3-second hold rate, shares, likes
- If metrics are strong, it triggers Wave 2
- If metrics are weak, distribution DIES here

**Wave 2 (1-6 hours): Expansion**
- If Wave 1 performed well, Instagram expands to a larger audience
- Now being tested with people who follow similar accounts or engage with similar topics
- The same metrics are measured again at this larger scale

**Wave 3 (6-24 hours): Peak Distribution**
- If Wave 2 metrics hold, the Reel enters peak visibility
- Can appear on Explore page, Reels tab, and in non-follower feeds
- This is where viral reach happens

**Wave 4 (24-48 hours+): Long Tail**
- Distribution continues but slows
- Reels with high save rates continue to get shown (saves = "evergreen" signal)
- Some Reels resurface weeks later if they keep getting engagement

**Critical data point:** 94% of Instagram distribution now comes from AI recommendations. The algorithm won't push content people immediately skip.

### 1.3 — Engagement Signal Hierarchy (Weighted)

Not all engagement is equal. Here is the confirmed weighting from heaviest to lightest:

| Signal | Weight | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **DM Shares/Sends** | HEAVIEST | "This is worth recommending to someone I know" — strongest quality signal |
| **Saves** | HEAVY | "I'll come back to this" — indicates lasting value |
| **Comments** | HEAVY | "I have something to say about this" — indicates emotional response |
| **Likes** | LIGHTER | Low-effort tap — still matters but less than above |
| **Watch Time / Retention** | FOUNDATIONAL | Not technically "engagement" but the #1 factor in initial distribution |

**The ratio that matters:** A post with 50 saves and 20 shares OUTRANKS a post with 200 likes but 0 shares. 100 likes matter less than 10 DM shares for reaching new audiences.

### 1.4 — Watch Time Breakdown

Watch time isn't just "did they watch to the end." Instagram now measures:

- **3-second hold rate:** Did the viewer stay past 3 seconds? (Critical threshold — Instagram HEAVILY weighs this)
- **Relative retention:** What % of the Reel was watched?
- **Total watch time:** Absolute seconds watched
- **Rewatch behavior:** Did they watch it again? (Very strong signal)
- **Immediate rewatch:** Did they replay it immediately? (Strongest retention signal)

**Key benchmark:** Reels with 60%+ 3-second hold rates outperform those with <40% hold rates by **5-10x in total reach.**

**Length vs. retention math:**
- A 60-second Reel with 70% completion OUTPERFORMS a 10-second Reel with 50% completion (total watch time wins)
- BUT a 10-second Reel with 80% retention BEATS a 60-second Reel with 30% retention (retention % matters when total watch time is low)

### 1.5 — Connected vs. Unconnected Reach

Instagram separates your reach into two categories:

**Connected Reach (your followers):**
- Driven primarily by: Likes per reach, consistency, community engagement
- Your followers see your content based on how much they interact with you
- Reply to comments, respond to DMs, post consistently = higher connected reach

**Unconnected Reach (strangers / discovery):**
- Driven primarily by: DM shares, watch time, hook strength
- This is where GROWTH happens — new followers, new customers
- Requires content that is SHAREABLE (people send it to friends)

**For BCH:** Unconnected reach is what drives new customers to the store. This means optimizing for DM shares is MORE important than optimizing for likes.

### 1.6 — The "Your Algorithm" Feature (December 2025)

Instagram launched "Your Algorithm" — users can now manually tell Instagram what topics they want more/less of. This means:

- Reels need to match topics your audience ACTIVELY CHOOSES, not just what Instagram predicts
- Content categorization matters more — Instagram needs to understand WHAT your Reel is about
- Keywords in captions, on-screen text, and audio all help categorization
- For BCH: Your Reels need to be clearly categorized as cycling/e-cycle/kids/family content through text and captions

### 1.7 — The Originality Score (2025-2026)

Instagram now uses an "Originality Score" to detect recycled content:

- **TikTok watermarks = automatic downrank.** Reels with visible TikTok logos get discovery penalties — they show to your followers but NOT in Explore or recommendations
- **Cross-platform recycled content performs 32% worse** than native content
- **CapCut watermarks** also trigger penalties
- **Your own brand logo is FINE** — Instagram clarified this in 2025
- Original audio, original voiceovers, and original concepts get algorithmic preference

**For BCH:** Always create content natively for Instagram. If you shoot for YouTube Shorts too, re-export without watermarks. Never upload with TikTok or CapCut logos visible.

## PART 2: POSTING SOP — BEFORE POSTING

### 2.1 — Best Posting Times for India (Bangalore/South India Audience)

Based on data from 9.6M+ posts and India-specific studies:

**Primary windows (highest engagement):**
| Time Slot (IST) | Why It Works |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **9:00 AM - 11:00 AM** | Morning commute + work breaks. Users starting their day, checking phone on bus/metro/auto |
| **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM** | Lunch break scroll. Peak mid-day engagement |
| **7:00 PM - 10:00 PM** | Post-work/school deep engagement. This is when people WATCH full Reels, not just scroll |

**Day-by-day best times:**
| Day | Best Times (IST) | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| Monday | 9 AM, 12 PM, 7 PM | People starting week, high scroll volume |
| Tuesday | 9 AM, 11 AM, 7 PM | Good engagement, less competition than Wed |
| Wednesday | 9 AM, 11 AM, 1 PM | **Best overall day** — highest average engagement |
| Thursday | 10 AM, 12 PM, 8 PM | Consistent mid-week engagement |
| Friday | 11 AM, 2 PM, 4 PM | End-of-work energy, people planning weekend |
| Saturday | 10 AM, 8 PM | Morning leisure + evening relaxation |
| Sunday | 11 AM, 7 PM | Family time browsing — **great for parent-kid content** |

**BCH-specific recommendation:**
- Post conversion content (product showcases, offers) on **Sunday 11 AM or 7 PM** — parents are with kids, browsing together, making weekend plans
- Post entertainment content (Mass Series, Pocket Bike) on **Wednesday 9-11 AM** for maximum algorithmic push
- Post time-sensitive offers on **Friday 4 PM** — people planning weekend purchases
- **Always check your Instagram Insights** for YOUR specific audience's active hours — override these general times with your own data

### 2.2 — Caption Optimization

**Length strategy:**
| Content Type | Caption Length | Purpose |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Entertainment Reels (Mass Series, PB) | Short: Under 150 characters | Don't slow down the scroll. Let the video do the work |
| Conversion Reels (product, offers) | Medium: 150-300 words | Include keywords, use cases, price, CTA |
| Educational Reels (comparisons, how-to) | Long: 300-500 words | Maximizes reading time (algorithm signal), stuffs keywords naturally |

**Keyword optimization:**
- Put your PRIMARY keyword in the FIRST LINE of the caption (before "...more")
- Keywords Instagram's algorithm reads: "e-cycle," "electric cycle," "kids cycle," "Bangalore," "e-bicycle"
- Use LSI (related) keywords naturally: "battery life," "no petrol," "chain-free," "eco-friendly," "cycling for kids"
- On-screen text in the Reel ALSO counts as keywords — Instagram reads text overlays for categorization

**CTA formulas that drive engagement:**
| CTA Type | Example | What It Triggers |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Share trigger | "Tag a parent who needs to see this" | DM shares (heaviest signal) |
| Save trigger | "Save this for when you visit BCH this weekend" | Saves (heavy signal) |
| Comment trigger | "What age did your kid start cycling? Comment below" | Comments (heavy signal) |
| DM trigger | "DM us 'CYCLE' for this week's price" | Direct conversation + saves |
| Store visit | "Show this Reel at BCH for a surprise gift" | Drives physical traffic |

**Caption structure for conversion Reels:**
```
[Bold opening line — restates the hook]
[2-3 lines of value: use case, pain point solved, feature]
[Price/offer line with specific numbers]
[CTA — one specific action]
.
.
.
[3-5 hashtags]
```

### 2.3 — Hashtag Strategy (2025-2026)

**Major change:** In December 2025, Instagram capped hashtags at **5 per post maximum.** More than 5 = reduced reach.

**The formula: 3-5 hashtags per Reel**
| Type | How Many | Examples for BCH |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Niche-specific | 2-3 | #ecycle #electriccycleindia #kidscycle |
| Location | 1 | #bangalorecycling #bangalorestore #bangalorekids |
| Trending/broad | 1 | #reelsviral #trending (only if relevant) |

**Hashtag strategy by content type:**
- **Entertainment:** #ecycle #bangalorelife #[trending tag] — max 3
- **Conversion:** #ecyclebangalore #electriccycleindia #ecyclestore #kidscycle — max 4-5
- **Local:** Always include ONE Bangalore-specific tag

**What changed:** Hashtags shifted from "growth levers" to "filing labels." They help Instagram CATEGORIZE your content but no longer drive significant discovery on their own. Your caption keywords and on-screen text matter MORE for discovery than hashtags.

### 2.4 — Cover Image / Thumbnail

**Dimensions:**
- Size: 1080 x 1920 pixels (9:16 ratio)
- Grid display crops to 1:1 (1080 x 1080) — center square only
- Home feed crops to 4:5

**Safe zone rules:**
- Keep ALL critical text/faces within the center 1080 x 1080 area
- Avoid putting anything in the top 250px or bottom 250px (gets cropped by UI elements)
- Leave the bottom 40% free of critical information (obscured by captions/buttons)

**Design best practices:**
- Bold, readable headline on the cover — tells viewers what the Reel is about BEFORE they tap
- Use consistent brand colors/fonts across all covers for a clean grid
- For BCH: Use your brand colors, include the cycle/product in every cover, add a 3-5 word headline
- Format: JPG or PNG, quality 80-90%

### 2.5 — Audio / Music Selection

**Trending audio impact:**
- Instagram actively promotes Reels using trending sounds
- When you use trending audio, Instagram can categorize your Reel and test it with audiences who previously engaged with that sound
- Trending audio naturally encourages longer watch time because viewers recognize the sound pattern

**Original audio advantage:**
- Instagram's algorithm gives preference to original audio and voiceovers
- The "Originality Score" rewards content that doesn't just copy trends verbatim
- Voiceover + trending background music = best of both worlds

**Strategy for BCH:**
| Content Type | Audio Strategy |
|-------------|---------------|
| Mass Series (MS1-MS33) | Use the ACTUAL movie BGMs — these are inherently trending in South India |
| Pocket Bike (PB1-PB50) | Original audio (reactions, dialogue) + trending background if relevant |
| Conversion Reels | Original voiceover (founder/staff speaking) — this gets preference |
| Entertainment Reels | Use audio that's STARTING to trend (not saturated) — catch the wave early |

**How to find trending audio:** Check the Reels tab — if you see a small arrow icon next to the audio name, it's currently trending. Use it within 3-5 days of noticing it for maximum boost.

## PART 3: POSTING SOP — FIRST 30 MINUTES AFTER POSTING

This is the most critical window. Wave 1 of the algorithm happens here.

### 3.1 — The 30-Minute Checklist (Do ALL of these)

| Minute | Action | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **0-1** | Post the Reel | - |
| **1-2** | Share the Reel to your Instagram Story | Gives your followers a second touchpoint. Story viewers who tap through count as views + engagement |
| **2-5** | Send the Reel via DM to 5-10 people who would genuinely care | Seed those DM shares. These early sends signal to the algorithm that the content is share-worthy |
| **5-30** | Stay on Instagram and reply to EVERY comment within seconds | Quick replies boost engagement velocity. Each reply = a new comment (doubles comment count). Replying fast encourages MORE comments |
| **5-30** | Like and respond to DMs about the Reel | DM conversations about your Reel signal engagement quality |
| **15-30** | Share the Reel link to your WhatsApp Status / WhatsApp groups (BCH customer groups) | Drives external traffic. When people click from WhatsApp to Instagram, it counts as a high-intent view |

### 3.2 — What NOT to Do in the First 30 Minutes

- **Do NOT edit the caption** after posting — editing resets some algorithmic signals
- **Do NOT delete and repost** if views are low initially — give it at least 24-48 hours
- **Do NOT cross-post to Facebook simultaneously** if you plan to boost/promote it later (Facebook cross-post prevents boosting)
- **Do NOT leave the app** — your active engagement in this window directly affects Wave 1 performance
- **Do NOT post another Reel** — wait at least 4-6 hours between Reels for optimal performance

### 3.3 — The Story Share Strategy

When sharing to Stories:
- Instagram automatically cuts Reels to 15 seconds in Stories
- Add a text sticker that creates curiosity: "Watch till the end" or "Wait for the price"
- Add a "Tap to watch full Reel" sticker
- If the Reel is conversion content, add a poll sticker: "Would you buy this for your kid? YES / NO" — polls drive engagement metrics on the Story which drives traffic to the Reel

### 3.4 — Seeding DM Shares

The most underrated tactic. DM shares are 3-5x more valuable than likes. Here's how to seed them:

1. **Before posting:** Identify 5-10 people (friends, family, loyal customers) who would genuinely find the Reel interesting
2. **After posting:** Send them the Reel via DM with a personal message: "Hey, thought you'd find this funny" or "This is the cycle I was telling you about"
3. **Why this works:** These initial DM shares tell the algorithm the content is share-worthy, triggering broader distribution
4. **Do NOT use engagement pods** (groups that all like/comment on each other's posts) — Instagram detects and penalizes this behavior

---

## PART 4: POSTING SOP — AFTER POSTING (ONGOING)

### 4.1 — 24-48 Hour Follow-Up

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **2-4 hours after posting** | Post a follow-up Story mentioning the Reel ("Have you seen our new Reel? The price will surprise you") |
| **6-12 hours after posting** | If the Reel is performing well, share it to Stories AGAIN with a new angle ("This Reel is blowing up — watch it if you haven't") |
| **24 hours** | Check Insights: watch time, shares, saves, reach (connected vs. unconnected). Note what worked |
| **48 hours** | If the Reel is still getting engagement, share it one more time in Stories |
| **1 week** | Pin the Reel to your profile grid if it performed well (keeps getting views from profile visitors) |

### 4.2 — Posting Frequency for BCH

**Recommended cadence:**
| Content Type | Frequency | Timing |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Reels | 3-5 per week | Space at least 6 hours apart |
| Stories | Daily, 2-4 per day | Every 2-3 hours during active hours |
| Feed posts (carousels) | 1-2 per week | For detailed product info, testimonials |

**Why this frequency:**
- More than 5 Reels/week = diminishing returns in reach and follower growth
- Consistency matters more than volume — a steady 4/week beats an erratic 7/week then 1/week
- Stories keep your profile "active" in followers' feeds even on non-Reel days

**BCH weekly content calendar suggestion:**
| Day | Content |
|-----|---------|
| Sunday | Conversion Reel (product showcase, offer, CTA) — parents browsing with kids |
| Monday | Story-only day (behind the scenes, customer testimonials, new arrivals) |
| Tuesday | Entertainment Reel (Mass Series / Pocket Bike) |
| Wednesday | Conversion Reel (different product or angle) — best engagement day |
| Thursday | Story-only day (polls, questions, countdown to weekend offers) |
| Friday | Entertainment Reel (new concept shoot) — weekend anticipation |
| Saturday | Conversion Reel (weekend-specific offer, "Visit BCH today") |

### 4.3 — Driving Traffic to BCH Physical Store

**Location tagging strategy:**
- Tag "Bharath Cycle Hub, Bangalore" on EVERY post and Story
- Use the Instagram Map feature — your store appears on the map when content is geotagged
- Use location-specific hashtags: #bangalorestore #bangaloreshopping #bangalorecycling
- Feature recognizable Bangalore landmarks or areas near BCH in Reels at least 1x per week

**Content that drives store visits:**
| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Scarcity/urgency** | "Only 3 left in stock at BCH. Walk in before they're gone" |
| **In-store exclusive** | "Show this Reel at BCH counter for a free accessory" |
| **Real customer proof** | Film real customers at the store. Others see social proof = "People actually go there" |
| **Price reveal at store** | "We can't post this price online. Visit BCH to see it" |
| **Free gifts** | "Walk-in only. BCH picks your free gift. Come see what you get" |

**Building "local density" (the 2025 growth unlock for local businesses):**
- Your biggest growth lever isn't viral Reels — it's building a high concentration of REAL, NEARBY followers who consistently engage
- When Instagram sees that users in Bangalore specifically engage with your content, it learns you're relevant to people in that area
- Then it shows your content to MORE people in Bangalore automatically
- Strategy: Every week, include at least 1 Reel featuring a recognizable local setting, local language (Kannada phrases, local slang), or local cultural reference

### 4.4 — Local vs. Broader Reach Strategy

**For LOCAL reach (Bangalore customers):**
- Use Bangalore geotag on everything
- Use Kannada or local slang in some Reels
- Feature real Bangalore streets, landmarks, and traffic around BCH
- Respond to every local commenter
- Run location-targeted ads on your best-performing Reels (radius: 25-50 km around BCH)

**For BROADER reach (brand building across India):**
- Entertainment content (Mass Series, Pocket Bike) naturally reaches pan-India
- Use Hindi/English for broader accessibility
- Use trending audio that's popular across India (not just Karnataka)
- This builds brand awareness that eventually drives online inquiries and destination visits

**The balance:** 70% local conversion content + 30% broad entertainment content

## PART 5: TECHNICAL OPTIMIZATION

### 5.1 — Video Specifications

| Spec | Optimal | Minimum |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Resolution** | 1080 x 1920 (Full HD) | 720p minimum |
| **Aspect Ratio** | 9:16 (vertical) | 4:5 works but doesn't fill screen |
| **Frame Rate** | 30 FPS | 30 FPS (don't go below) |
| **File Format** | MP4 or MOV | - |
| **Max Length** | 3 minutes (180 seconds) | - |
| **Max File Size** | 4GB | - |

### 5.2 — Ideal Video Length

| Purpose | Optimal Length | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| **Maximum virality / discovery** | 7-15 seconds | Highest completion rate. Easy to rewatch. Best for entertainment hooks |
| **Balanced reach + storytelling** | 15-30 seconds | Sweet spot for most BCH content. Enough for hook + value + CTA |
| **Detailed product showcase** | 30-60 seconds | Allows for the MVP formula: Hook > Use Case > Price > Value > CTA |
| **In-depth content** | 60-90 seconds | Only if every 3-5 seconds delivers NEW value. Completion rate drops significantly after 60s |
| **Avoid** | 90+ seconds | Unless truly exceptional. Most viewers drop off hard after 60-90 seconds |

**BCH content length guide:**
- Mass Series / Pocket Bike comedy: 15-30 seconds
- Product showcase (MVP formula): 30-60 seconds
- Offer announcements: 15-30 seconds
- Customer moments: 15-30 seconds

### 5.3 — Text Overlay Best Practices

**Why text overlays matter:**
- 85% of social media videos are watched with sound OFF
- Creators have seen watch time DOUBLE by adding well-formatted captions
- On-screen text gives Instagram additional keywords for categorization and discovery
- Captions are now a core ranking signal, not just an accessibility feature

**Rules:**
| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Max words per overlay | 5-7 words per text block |
| Font | Bold, clean, sans-serif. Consistent across all Reels |
| Position | CENTER of screen. Avoid top 15% and bottom 40% |
| Animation | Subtle only — fade-in or gentle pop. No spinning/bouncing text |
| Keyword emphasis | Bold or color ONE key word per overlay (e.g., "**FREE** delivery to your door") |
| Safe zone | All text within the central 1080 x 1350 area (4:5 ratio within the 9:16 frame) |

**For BCH specifically:**
- Always overlay the PRICE on screen (viewers watch on mute, price is the key info)
- Always overlay the CTA on screen ("Visit BCH" / "DM us CYCLE")
- Use consistent BCH brand colors for text overlays
- Include "Bangalore" or "BCH" in at least one text overlay per conversion Reel (helps local categorization)

### 5.4 — Export Settings (From Editing Software)

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Codec | H.264 |
| Container | .mp4 |
| Resolution | 1080 x 1920 |
| Frame rate | 30 FPS |
| Bitrate | 10-20 Mbps (higher = better quality but larger file) |
| Audio | AAC, 128-256 kbps |

**Do NOT:**
- Export with TikTok or CapCut watermarks
- Use filters that degrade quality
- Compress below 720p
- Upload via desktop if possible — Instagram's mobile upload pipeline generally produces better results

---

## PART 6: THE SHARE/SAVE ECONOMY — THE KEY TO BCH GROWTH

### 6.1 — Why Shares and Saves Are the New Currency

The old Instagram was likes-driven. The 2025-2026 Instagram is shares-and-saves-driven.

**The math:**
- 10 DM shares > 100 likes (for reaching new audiences)
- 50 saves + 20 shares > 200 likes with 0 shares (for overall ranking)
- Shares = "I want someone ELSE to see this" = strongest quality signal
- Saves = "I want to come back to this" = strongest value signal

**What each signal tells Instagram:**
| Signal | Instagram interprets as | Distribution impact |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| DM Share | "This content is worth personally recommending" | Expands to non-followers aggressively |
| Save | "This content has lasting value worth revisiting" | Long-tail distribution; Reel resurfaces over time |
| Comment | "This content sparked an emotional response" | Moderate expansion |
| Like | "This content was decent" | Maintains current distribution; minor boost |

### 6.2 — How to Optimize Content for Shares

People share content that falls into these categories:

| Share Trigger | How to Use for BCH | Example |
|--------------|--------------------|---------|
| **"My friend NEEDS to see this"** | Create content that targets a SPECIFIC relationship (parent-kid, husband-wife, friend group) | A Reel about a kid's chain breaking = a parent tags/sends to their kid. "This is literally you" |
| **"This is so relatable"** | Show TG daily-life moments exaggerated. When someone sees their own life on screen, they send it to someone who'll understand | A parent struggling to fit a cycle in a car = every parent sends this to their spouse |
| **"This price/deal is too good"** | Price-reveal or offer content that feels like insider information | "BCH is giving FREE [item] with every e-cycle this weekend" — people forward deals to family |
| **"This is hilarious"** | Pure comedy that makes someone think of a specific person | Mass Series content — people send movie-reference comedy to friends who love those actors |
| **"This is useful information"** | Educational content people want to reference later or share with someone making a purchase decision | "5 things to check before buying an e-cycle" — parents share with other parents considering the purchase |

### 6.3 — How to Optimize Content for Saves

People save content they want to:
1. **Reference later** — comparisons, price lists, feature breakdowns
2. **Show someone in person** — "I need to show my husband this when he gets home"
3. **Act on later** — offers with a deadline, store directions, product details

**Content structures that trigger saves:**

| Structure | BCH Application |
|-----------|----------------|
| **List/checklist** | "7 things every parent should know before buying an e-cycle" |
| **Price comparison** | "E-cycle vs. petrol bike: 3-year cost breakdown" |
| **Before/after** | "How much a family saves switching from auto fare to e-cycle" |
| **Tutorial/how-to** | "How to choose the right e-cycle size for your kid" |
| **Offer with deadline** | "This weekend only: Free [gift] with every purchase at BCH" |
| **Product specs** | "Stream of Rad electric cycle — full specs in 30 seconds" |

### 6.4 — Building Share/Save Triggers INTO Scripts

This is the key change from the old content approach. Every BCH Reel script should have deliberate moments designed to trigger shares or saves:

**The Share/Save Script Framework:**

```
SECOND 0-3: TG-specific hook (stops the scroll for the RIGHT audience)
SECOND 3-8: First value drop (new information — triggers "oh, I didn't know that")
SECOND 8-15: Second value drop (comparison, use case, or pain point solved)
SECOND 15-20: Price/offer reveal (triggers "I need to save/share this deal")
SECOND 20-25: Social proof or scarcity ("Only at BCH" / "50 families bought this week")
SECOND 25-30: CTA (specific action: "Visit BCH this Sunday" / "DM us CYCLE")
```

**At WHICH moments to insert share/save triggers:**
- **After the price reveal:** "Send this to someone who's been thinking about an e-cycle"
- **After showing the free gift:** "Save this — you'll want to remember when you visit"
- **After the relatable moment:** "Tag the parent who does this every morning"
- **In the caption:** "Save for your next BCH visit" or "Share with a parent who needs this"

### 6.5 — Share/Save Benchmarks to Track

| Metric | Good | Great | Viral |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| **Save rate** (saves / reach) | 1-2% | 3-5% | 5%+ |
| **Share rate** (sends / reach) | 0.5-1% | 1-3% | 3%+ |
| **Save-to-like ratio** | 1:10 | 1:5 | 1:3 or higher |
| **Share-to-like ratio** | 1:20 | 1:10 | 1:5 or higher |

If your Reel is getting lots of likes but very few saves/shares, the content is entertaining but not VALUABLE or RELATABLE enough to trigger the "send to a friend" instinct.
