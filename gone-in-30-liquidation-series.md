# GONE IN 30 — Premium Bike Liquidation Series

> 30 premium bikes. 30 days. Up to 40% off. Dealer margin is 25%. The owner is LOSING money on purpose.

---

## THE PREMISE

A bike shop owner goes through a slow public BREAKDOWN as he liquidates 30 premium bikes at below-cost prices. Each day, the "madness" escalates. He's not running a sale — he's running a clearance at his own expense. The LOSS is the entertainment. The deals are real.

**Why this works as a series:**
- Story arc across 30 days — viewers follow the journey, come back daily
- Physical hooks every single reel (marker slashing, price ripping, calculator throwing)
- Dark comedy engine: a man voluntarily destroying his profit margin on camera
- Built-in urgency: real countdown, real stock vanishing from the store
- Cycling enthusiasts see REAL specs + REAL prices on bikes they recognize

**TG:** Male 20-45, Bangalore cycling enthusiasts, fitness riders, commuters who know what a Shimano groupset means. These people browse cycling forums, follow Strava, know MRP of premium bikes. When they see the slashed price, they'll KNOW it's below cost.

**Format:** Every reel is 15-25 seconds. Physical hook (0-3 sec) → Bike feature or story beat (3-15 sec) → CTA + count remaining (15-20 sec)

## 5 CONTENT TYPES

### TYPE 1 — THE SLASH (Price Destruction)
Owner physically destroys his own prices. Fat red marker. Aggressive energy. This is the SIGNATURE move of the series.

### TYPE 2 — THE FEATURE (Bike Spotlight)
One bike. Quick specs. Slashed price. The bike does the talking.

### TYPE 3 — THE REACTION (Social Proof)
Real customers seeing the prices. Real shock. The moment of "wait, HOW much?" captured on camera.

### TYPE 4 — THE COUNTDOWN (Urgency)
Empty bike slots. Dwindling stock. The store getting emptier reel by reel.

### TYPE 5 — THE LOSS (Dark Comedy)
Owner calculating his losses out loud. The damage report. Still going. Getting more unhinged.

## THE CONCEPTS

---

### G1. THE FIRST SLASH — Launch Reel (Type 1)

**Hook (0-2 sec):** Extreme close-up. A fat red marker tip touches a laminated price tag. SLASHES across the MRP — ₹48,000. The squeak of marker on laminate. New price scrawled below: ₹28,800. The gap is VIOLENT.

**Body (2-12 sec):** Pull back. 30 premium bikes lined up across the store floor. Owner walks down the line with the marker, slashing every single price tag. Slash. Slash. Slash. Time-lapse it. His face is DEAD SERIOUS the entire time. Not smiling. Not celebrating. This is not a festive sale — this is a man clearing house.

**Close (12-18 sec):** Caps the marker. Turns to camera. "30 premium bikes. Road. MTB. Hybrid. Up to 40% off. My margin is 25%. You do the math. I'm not making money — I'm making space. Walk in or DM 'GONE.'"

**Text overlay:** 30 BIKES. 30 DAYS. UP TO 40% OFF.

**Audio:** Dark, intense BGM — building tension during the slashing montage. Think heist-movie prep scene.

**Why it works:** The AGGRESSIVE price slashing is the visual hook. Viewers SEE real MRPs getting destroyed. The owner openly admitting he's below margin creates TRUST. "You do the math" makes people actually calculate — and realize the deal is below cost. This one sets the tone for the entire series.

---

### G2. THE CALCULATOR CONFESSION — Day 2 (Type 5)

**Hook (0-3 sec):** Close-up of a calculator screen. Fingers typing. The number goes NEGATIVE. Red digits. The owner's hand FREEZES on the calculator.

**Body (3-12 sec):** Owner turns the calculator to face the camera. "This is what I lose on every bike I sell this month." Beat. He stares at it. Then he DROPS the calculator on the counter. It bounces. "But I need 30 bikes gone in 30 days." He picks up a specific bike — wheels it into frame. Quick specs: brand, frame, groupset, type. Shows the old tag. Shows the new price.

**Close (12-18 sec):** "Yesterday was Day 1. This is Day 2. 29 left. The math gets worse every day and I'm still here." DM 'GONE' / walk in.

**Audio:** Slow piano that cuts to silence when the calculator shows negative.

---

### G3. THE LINEUP — Day 3 (Type 2)

**Hook (0-3 sec):** Owner ROLLS a premium road bike into the center of the store like he's presenting evidence. Kickstand down. Steps back. Arms crossed. Stares at it.

**Body (3-15 sec):** Camera circles the bike slowly. Owner narrates like he's introducing a fighter entering the ring:

"[Brand + model]. Aluminum frame. Shimano [groupset]. 21-speed. Weighs [X] kg. MRP: ₹[price]."

He pulls out the red marker. Slashes. Writes the new price.

"My price: ₹[slashed price]. That's ₹[difference] less than what I paid for it."

**Close (15-20 sec):** "28 left. Walk in. Jayanagar, Bangalore." Bike stays in frame. Price tag visible.

**Audio:** Boxing ring bell + entrance music energy.

---

### G4. THE CUSTOMER FREEZE — (Type 3)

**Hook (0-2 sec):** A real customer is looking at a bike in the store. Staff tells them the price. The customer's hand literally STOPS mid-air reaching for their wallet. Freeze frame. Record scratch sound.

**Body (2-12 sec):** Unfreeze. Customer: "Wait — how much?" Staff repeats the price. Customer looks at the bike. Looks at the tag. Looks back at staff. "That's the REAL price? Not EMI?" "That's the full price. Cash." Customer pulls out phone, starts texting someone — calling a friend. "Bro get here NOW."

**Close (12-18 sec):** Text overlay with the bike model + slashed price. "[X] bikes left."

**Audio:** Record scratch → comedic "wait what" energy.

**Note:** Shoot this EVERY TIME a real customer has a genuine reaction to the price. Stockpile these clips. Authentic reactions > scripted drama. Even a 5-second genuine "bro WHAT" is worth a reel.

---

### G5. THE BEFORE/AFTER STORE — Day 7-ish (Type 4)

**Hook (0-2 sec):** Split screen or quick cut. LEFT: store packed with 30 bikes (Day 1 footage). RIGHT: store today — visibly emptier. The GAP between the two frames is the hook.

**Body (2-10 sec):** Camera pans across the empty slots where bikes used to be. Maybe a sticker or chalk outline where each sold bike was — like a crime scene body outline. "This one went to a guy in Whitefield. This one to a couple in Indiranagar. This one — gone in 20 minutes."

**Close (10-15 sec):** Pans to the remaining bikes. "[X] left. The empty spaces aren't coming back."

**Audio:** Eerie, quiet BGM. Let the empty store speak.

---

### G6. THE SIDE-BY-SIDE — (Type 2, repeat format)

**Hook (0-3 sec):** Owner SLAMS two phones on the counter, screens facing camera. One shows the SAME bike model on another website at full MRP. The other shows his price tag — 35-40% lower. The gap is visible in one glance. His hand slaps the counter between the two phones.

**Body (3-12 sec):** "Same bike. Same specs. Same brand. Same everything. [Other site]: ₹[full price]. Me: ₹[slashed price]. I'm not undercutting them — I'm undercutting MYSELF. My cost is higher than this price."

**Close (12-15 sec):** "[X] left. You know where to find me."

**Audio:** Auction hammer sound on the counter slap.

**Note:** This format is REPEATABLE. Do it for 3-4 different bikes across the 30 days. Each time, a different online comparison. People WILL screenshot this and share it in cycling WhatsApp groups.

---

### G7. THE DAMAGE REPORT — Day 10-ish (Type 5)

**Hook (0-3 sec):** Owner sits at his desk. A single harsh light on his face. He opens a notebook. The page header reads: "LOSSES — WEEK 1." There are NUMBERS. Real ones. He turns it to the camera.

**Body (3-12 sec):** "10 days in. [X] bikes sold. Here's what I've lost so far." Shows the running total. It's a real, visible, painful number. "My accountant called me yesterday. I told him to call back in 20 days." Slight smile for the first time. "Still [X] bikes left."

**Close (12-15 sec):** "The damage report continues tomorrow. Walk in."

**Audio:** Office/accounting vibes — keyboard clicking, paper rustling. Then silence on the loss reveal.

**Note:** Do this every 7-10 days. The RUNNING TOTAL of losses escalating is its own story arc. People will come back just to see how much he's lost.

---

### G8. THE PHONE CALL — (Type 3)

**Hook (0-2 sec):** Tight shot of owner's phone screen. An incoming call: "DISTRIBUTOR." He stares at it. Lets it ring. Declines the call.

**Body (2-12 sec):** Looks at camera. "He wants to know why I'm selling [brand] below dealer price. Because I am. ₹[price] for a bike that costs ME ₹[cost]." Picks up a specific bike. "This [model] — full Shimano, disc brakes, [frame material]. MRP ₹[price]. I'm letting it go at ₹[slashed price]." Turns back to the phone. "I'll call him back after all 30 are gone."

**Close (12-15 sec):** "[X] left."

**Audio:** Phone ringtone as hook, then cuts to silence.

---

### G9. THE GHOST STORE — Day 20+ (Type 4)

**Hook (0-3 sec):** Wide shot of the store. It looks EMPTY compared to Day 1. Actual tumbleweeds energy. Owner walks through the empty spaces. His footsteps echo.

**Body (3-12 sec):** Camera follows him as he walks past empty rack after empty rack. He stops at the remaining bikes — maybe 8-10 left. "20 days ago, you couldn't walk through here. Now look at it." Touches one of the remaining bikes. "These are the last ones. Once they're gone, I'm restocking at full price. No more clearance. No more below cost."

**Close (12-15 sec):** "[X] bikes left. After this, prices go back to normal."

**Audio:** Echo-y, empty warehouse vibes. Footsteps prominent.

---

### G10. THE WHATSAPP STORM — (Type 3)

**Hook (0-2 sec):** Owner's phone screen — WhatsApp notifications FLOODING in. Message after message. The phone is physically BUZZING on the counter, vibrating across the surface.

**Body (2-10 sec):** He picks up the phone. Scrolls through DMs. "Everyone's asking the same thing: 'Is this real?' 'What's the catch?'" He puts the phone down. Looks at camera. "The catch is I lose money and you get a premium bike for less than I bought it. That's the whole catch."

**Close (10-15 sec):** Features one specific bike with specs + price. "[X] left."

**Audio:** Rapid notification sounds as hook, then calm.

---

### G11. THE GOODBYE — (Type 2 + Type 5 hybrid)

**Hook (0-2 sec):** Owner RUNS HIS HAND along the frame of a premium bike. Slowly. Like saying goodbye to someone.

**Body (2-15 sec):** "I'm going to be honest. This [model] — I didn't want to sell this one. [Quick specs: brand, frame, groupset]. This is a ₹[MRP] bike. I have it at ₹[slashed price]. Someone's going to walk in today and take it from me." Pats the seat. Steps back. "Go ahead. It deserves to be ridden, not sitting in my store."

**Close (15-20 sec):** "[X] left. Walk in. Jayanagar."

**Audio:** Sentimental/emotional track — but played slightly for comedy because it's a BIKE, not a person.

**Note:** Use this format for your 3-4 BEST bikes. The ones that genuinely hurt to sell at this price. The sincerity + absurdity of mourning a bicycle is the comedy.

---

### G12. THE FINAL COUNTDOWN — Last 5 Bikes (Type 4)

**Hook (0-3 sec):** Owner DRAGS a cloth/tarp over the empty bike racks. Covering them. Like covering furniture in a house you're leaving. Only 5 bikes remain uncovered, spotlit.

**Body (3-12 sec):** "We started with 30. 25 people walked out of here with premium bikes at below-cost prices." Camera slowly reveals each of the 5 remaining. Quick flash of each: model, price. "These 5 are it. After these, this clearance is DONE. I go back to full price. My accountant goes back to normal blood pressure."

**Close (12-15 sec):** "5 left. Final days. You know the number."

**Audio:** Countdown timer ticking.

---

### G13. THE LAST ONE — Final Bike (Type 4 + 5)

**Hook (0-2 sec):** A single spotlight on a single bike in an otherwise empty section of the store. Nothing else in frame.

**Body (2-12 sec):** Owner walks into frame. Stands next to it. "This is it. The last one. 29 bikes gone. 29 losses on my books." Shows the running total loss one final time. "Was it worth it?" Looks at the bike. Looks at camera. "Ask the 29 people riding right now."

**Close (12-15 sec):** "[Model]. ₹[price]. Walk in today. When this one's gone, it's over."

**Audio:** Single piano note. Silence. Then the reel ends.

- G4 (Customer Freeze) — shoot EVERY genuine reaction, stockpile clips
- G6 (Side-by-Side) — 3-4 times with different bikes/websites
- G11 (The Goodbye) — 3-4 times for the best bikes

**STORY ARC:** The owner goes from dead serious (Week 1) → slightly unhinged (Week 2) → openly questioning his decisions (Week 3) → resigned/peaceful (Week 4). This PROGRESSION keeps the series alive and gives viewers a reason to come back.

---

## THE CTA SYSTEM

Every single reel ends with ONE of these:

- **"DM 'GONE'"** — simple, memorable, trackable
- **"Walk in — Jayanagar, Bangalore"** — for local reach
- **"[X] bikes left"** — the number ALWAYS visible
- **Phone number on screen** — for direct calls

The CTA is SHORT. Never more than one line spoken + one line on screen.

---

## AUDIO DIRECTION

| Concept Type | Audio Vibe |
|-------------|-----------|
| Slash/Price Destruction | Heist movie tension, building drums |
| Bike Features | Boxing ring / fight entrance energy |
| Customer Reactions | Record scratch → comedic beats |
| Countdown/Empty Store | Eerie silence, echoing footsteps, clock ticking |
| Loss/Dark Comedy | Piano, quiet office sounds, dramatic silence |
| Final Reel | Single note. Silence. End. |

Use trending Reel audio wherever possible — but the VISUAL must work on mute too.

## TARGETING & REACH

**Hashtags (rotate across reels):**
- #BangaloreCycling #CycleShopBangalore #RoadBikeSale #MTBIndia #HybridCycle
- #CycleClearance #BikeSale #PremiumCycle #ShimanoBike #CyclingDeals
- #Jayanagar #BangaloreDeals #GoneIn30 #BCH #BharathCycleHub

**Geo-tag:** BCH store, Jayanagar, Bangalore — EVERY reel.

**Share targets:** Post in Bangalore cycling WhatsApp groups/Telegram. Tag local cycling pages. The Side-by-Side (G6) comparison reels are built to be SCREENSHOTTED and shared in groups.

**Collab/Tag:** If any known Bangalore cyclist buys during the clearance, get them in a reel. One known face > 10 anonymous reactions.

---

## RULES FOR THIS SERIES

1. **NEVER fake the stock count.** If 22 are left, say 22. Trust is the entire game here. Cycling enthusiasts are detail people — they WILL check.
2. **Show REAL specs.** Brand name, groupset, frame material, wheel size. This audience knows bikes. Don't be vague.
3. **The red marker is your signature.** Use it in every price-slashing reel. It becomes the visual identity of the series.
4. **One bike per feature reel.** Don't clump 5 bikes in one video. Each bike deserves its own spotlight.
5. **Capture EVERY real customer reaction.** Even a 3-second "bro what" is content gold. Keep the camera ready at all times.
6. **The loss is real — lean into it.** Don't hide the fact that you're selling below cost. The transparency IS the hook. "My margin is 25%, I'm giving 40% off" — that one line does more than any ad.
7. **Cross-post Stories daily.** Every day, even without a reel, post a Story: updated bike count, quick walkaround of remaining stock, a close-up of a slashed price tag.

## THE ONE-LINE PITCH

**"A bike shop owner publicly loses money for 30 days straight, one premium bike at a time, and films the whole thing."**

If that sentence makes people curious — the series works.
