## RANKING — Strongest to Weakest Hook

---

### #1. night heist police.mp4 — SCORE: 72/100
**Profile:** BCH Main (crime-genre content)
**Duration:** 63.0s
**What I see:** DARK night scene. Figures moving near an auto-rickshaw. Blue police-type lights flashing. Handcuff icons on screen. Kannada text overlay about midnight cycle stealing. Everything screams CRIME SCENE — but it's clearly a cycle purchase.
**What I hear:** "Sir, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're going to start playing..."

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. BEST hook in the entire batch — the night setting + blue police lights + handcuff icons is exactly the genre-mismatch that stops scrolls. Keep this energy.
2. The footage is TOO DARK — you can barely see what's happening. Add one more light source or shoot where streetlights are brighter. Mystery is good, pitch-black is frustrating.
3. The first frame needs ONE clear visual anchor — a face, a cycle, a hand. Right now it's just dark shapes. Give the viewer something to LOCK ONTO in the darkness.

### #2. dirt pocket bike.mp4 — SCORE: 65/100
**Profile:** BCH Main / Pocket Bike content
**Duration:** 25.4s
**What I see:** OUTDOOR dusty setting. A grown person is crouched over the tiny pocket bike doing stunts/tricks. Multiple people watching. The size contrast (big person, tiny bike) is immediate. Physical ACTION from frame 1 — the person is in motion, not standing still.
**What I hear:** "YA"

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The size contrast (grown adult on 2-foot bike) is doing ALL the work — this is inherently a scroll-stopper. Lean into it harder — shoot even lower to the ground to make the person look MORE ridiculous on the tiny bike.
2. The background watchers are GOLD — their reactions are visible. Next time, get one wide shot where we see both the stunt AND the crowd reacting in the same frame.
3. The dusty outdoor setting feels RAW and real, which is perfect. Don't move this content indoors — the street energy is what makes it different from every other clean store video.

### #3. kidnap part 1.mp4 — SCORE: 58/100
**Profile:** BCH Main (skit/entertainment)
**Duration:** 22.7s
**What I see:** NIGHT scene. Two people — one in blue, one in black. "Kidnap" text overlay in red. Dark, moody lighting with colored ambient lights. Body language suggests dramatic tension/skit setup. The nighttime aesthetic is completely different from everything else.
**What I hear:** "Hello miss you, how do you feel"

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The "Kidnap" text + night setting is doing the heavy lifting — anyone scrolling will stop to figure out what's happening. The concept is right.
2. The two characters are just STANDING there in the first 3 seconds — you need physical action. One should be GRABBING the other, or running, or dragging. The word "kidnap" promises action, but the visual is two guys chatting at night.
3. Add urgency to the camera — handheld shake, quick zoom-ins, whip pans. Right now the camera is too steady for a "kidnap" scenario. The camera should feel like it's WITNESSING something.

---

### #4. dancing boy.mp4 — SCORE: 55/100
**Profile:** BCH Toyz / BCH Main
**Duration:** 41.7s
**What I see:** A kid in a RED shirt DANCING in the store from frame 1. Arms up, body moving, high energy. Cycles and toys visible in background. "dancing boy" text overlay. The kid is PERFORMING — not standing, not talking.
**What I hear:** Music/dance audio

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. This is one of the ONLY videos where there's physical MOVEMENT from the very first frame — the kid dancing immediately catches the eye. Red shirt against the store background pops. Keep casting kids who bring this energy.
2. The camera is too far away and too static — get CLOSER. Fill the frame with the kid's energy. A medium shot of the kid dancing is 3x more engaging than a wide shot where he's small in the frame.
3. The "dancing boy" text is wasted — it describes what you already SEE. Use the text to create a QUESTION instead: "This kid walked in and..." or "Nobody expected this." The text should add curiosity, not narrate.

---

### #5. TOY-005_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 48/100
**Profile:** BCH Toyz (@bch_toyz)
**Duration:** 35.8s
**What I see:** A TODDLER (2-3 years old) standing in front of ROWS of colorful ride-on bikes. The kid is tiny against a WALL of red, blue, yellow, green toys. "HAPPY CUSTOMER" text overlay. The color contrast is naturally eye-catching.
**What I hear:** Background music only

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The visual of a tiny kid in a toy PARADISE is naturally appealing for parents — this is the right setup. The colors behind the kid are doing half the work.
2. But the kid is just STANDING there. Get the kid's REACTION — the moment they first SEE the toys, eyes going wide, running toward one. That MOMENT of joy is worth 10x more than a kid standing politely.
3. "HAPPY CUSTOMER" text is generic and tells the viewer the emotion instead of letting them FEEL it. Remove it. Or replace with something that creates curiosity: "She picked the one nobody expected."

---

### #6. TOY-002_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 42/100
**Profile:** BCH Toyz (@bch_toyz)
**Duration:** 57.1s
**What I see:** Opens OUTSIDE the store — "BHARATH CYCLE HUB" signage visible. Someone walking/entering. "WAIT FOR MONSTER BIKE" text overlay. Store entrance shots. Something red visible around 2.5s suggesting a reveal setup.
**What I hear:** Barely audible

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. "WAIT FOR MONSTER BIKE" text is doing the right job — it creates anticipation. But the visual MUST match the promise. The first 3 seconds should show the cloth/cover over the bike, not the store exterior.
2. Don't waste the first 3 seconds on the store sign and walking. START with the covered/hidden bike and someone about to reveal it. The reveal setup IS the hook — not the walk-up to the store.
3. The outdoor shots of the store front are filler. Every second of the first 3 seconds must serve the hook. Cut the establishing shot entirely and jump straight to the action.

---

### #7. TOY-001_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 40/100
**Profile:** BCH Toyz (@bch_toyz)
**Duration:** 57.3s
**What I see:** 2-3 men in the store in what appears to be a skit setup. One in khaki, one in checkered shirt. Some dramatic energy — people moving, interacting. Kannada text overlay visible.
**What I hear (Tamil):** Dialogue suggesting a skit/scene

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. There's ENERGY in this frame — multiple people, movement, a dramatic interaction. This is better than static product shots. The skit format has potential.
2. But I can't tell WHAT'S HAPPENING in 3 seconds. The viewer needs to understand the setup INSTANTLY. Add clearer character roles (costumes, props) so the genre is obvious at a glance.
3. The store interior looks the same as every other video. If you're doing a skit, change ONE thing about the environment — dim the lights, add a prop, use an angle that makes the store look different.

### #8. self content biuke charg.mp4 — SCORE: 40/100
**Profile:** BCH Main / Wattson Wheelz
**Duration:** 23.8s
**What I see:** TIGHT close-up of an e-cycle digital DASHBOARD glowing in the dark. Speed reading (29-30 kmph), battery indicator, digital display. "E-Cycle vs E-Bike" text in red. The glowing dashboard in darkness has a tech/gadget feel.
**What I hear (Hindi):** About kilometers and range

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The glowing dashboard close-up in the dark is visually DIFFERENT from everything else — it has a tech/POV feel that would appeal to gear enthusiasts. The "E-Cycle vs E-Bike" text hooks the comparison-shopper.
2. But it's a STATIC shot of a dashboard. Add motion — the speed numbers climbing, the camera pulling back to reveal who's riding, or the POV of the road ahead. Static tech = boring, moving tech = exciting.
3. This hook works for a NICHE audience (e-bike enthusiasts) but won't stop a random parent scrolling. Know which profile this goes on — it's Wattson Wheelz content, not Main page content.

---

### #9. TOY-003_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 38/100
**Profile:** BCH Toyz (@bch_toyz)
**Duration:** 17.5s
**What I see:** Kid sitting on a ride-on Mercedes car inside the store. "MERCEDES CAR JUST" text overlay (hinting at price). Blue/neon lighting. Colorful toy-filled store environment. Adults and kid visible.
**What I hear:** Barely audible

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. A kid on a Mercedes ride-on car in a colorful lit-up store is decent content for the Toyz page TG. The blue lighting adds visual appeal. The "MERCEDES CAR JUST [price]" text hooks budget-conscious parents.
2. But the kid is sitting STILL on the car. Show the kid DRIVING it, pulling up, honking, doing something a kid would actually do. A kid sitting on a parked toy = catalog photo. A kid zooming around = video content.
3. The lighting is good but the camera angle is flat — shoot from the kid's level (low to the ground) so the Mercedes car looks BIG and impressive, not from above where it looks like a toy.

---

### #10. EMD-002_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 35/100
**Profile:** Unknown (EMD series)
**Duration:** 64.2s
**What I see:** Man in white shirt from behind/side. "FRUSTRATED FATHER" text with angry face emoji overlay. Two men interacting in the store. The father's body language reads tense/upset (arms crossed, leaning in).
**What I hear:** "I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die."

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The "FRUSTRATED FATHER" concept is RELATABLE — every parent shopping for a cycle has been frustrated. The emoji overlay + text does create some character setup. The concept direction is right.
2. But the opening is two men STANDING in a store. The frustration needs to be PHYSICAL in the first frame — the father slamming his hand on the counter, throwing his hands up, turning to walk out. SHOW the frustration, don't label it.
3. The audio "I'm not going to die" is actually intriguing — if the spoken hook is that dramatic, make sure the VISUAL matches. His face should be in close-up for that line, not a medium shot from behind.

---

### #11. Toys 5861.mp4 — SCORE: 35/100
**Profile:** BCH Toyz
**Duration:** 30.8s
**What I see:** Outdoor scene. "Kids Dream Arrived" text appearing letter by letter (animated). A kid near a truck/delivery vehicle. Sunny outdoor setting. The animated text reveal builds anticipation. By 2-3s, shows kid near what appears to be an unboxing/delivery.
**What I hear:** Barely audible

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The animated "Kids Dream Arrived" text is a nice touch — letter-by-letter reveal creates a small anticipation loop. The delivery/truck setting hints at something exciting arriving.
2. But the first 2 frames are unclear — you can't immediately tell what's happening. The kid needs to be VISIBLE and reacting from frame 1. Start with the kid's face seeing the truck, not the truck alone.
3. The outdoor delivery format is underused and has potential. But compress the setup — don't spend 3 seconds getting to the point. Frame 1 = kid's shocked face. Frame 2 = truck door opening. That's the hook.

---

### #12. TOY-004_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 32/100
**Profile:** BCH Toyz (@bch_toyz)
**Duration:** 22.8s
**What I see:** Outdoor scene shot from slightly above. Multiple colorful ride-on toys (green, blue, red) scattered in front of a shop. People around them. "BIG OFFER" text in large red letters. Busy, colorful scene.
**What I hear:** Numbers "3,1,4,5,6,8"

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The COLORS are working for you — multiple bright ride-on toys in one frame is visually appealing. The sheer quantity of products creates a "wow, so many choices" feeling.
2. But the "BIG OFFER" text is the most GENERIC possible overlay. Every store on Instagram uses "BIG OFFER." Replace with a specific hook: "All under Rs. 5,000" or "These 3 won't last the week" — specificity stops scrolls, generics don't.
3. The composition is TOO MESSY — there's no focal point. Pick ONE hero product, put it center frame, and let the others be background. Right now the eye has nowhere to land.

---

### #13. Kerala Bulk Cycle.mp4 — SCORE: 30/100
**Profile:** BCH Main
**Duration:** 34.9s
**What I see:** Outdoor street scene with a delivery truck. Text overlay visible. Kids/people near a truck loaded with cycles. Handling/checking cycles. Standard B-roll footage of a bulk delivery operation.
**What I hear (Hindi/Kannada):** About buying cycles

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The SCALE of the truck operation is mildly interesting — "why so many cycles?" But it reads as B-roll, not as a hook. You need a STORY: "One family drove from Kerala for THESE."
2. Don't start with the truck. Start with the PEOPLE — their faces, their excitement, their journey. A family's face arriving after a 300km drive is a hook. A truck full of cycles is logistics.
3. The outdoor sunlight is harsh and the framing is casual/unplanned. Even organic content needs one composed opening frame. Lock the first shot, THEN go handheld.

---

### #14. Petrol yelli hakodu.mp4 — SCORE: 30/100
**Profile:** BCH Main / Wattson Wheelz
**Duration:** 29.9s
**What I see:** Indoor setting (office/store). "Petrol E-Cycle" text overlay with fuel pump emoji. Multiple people sitting/talking. The title "Petrol yelli hakodu" (Where to put petrol?) is a clever concept.
**What I hear (Kannada):** "Sir electric cycle, where to put petrol?"

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The CONCEPT is funny — "Where do I put petrol in an electric cycle?" Every Indian can relate to this confusion. The concept is solid.
2. But the VISUAL is people sitting in a room talking. The concept needs a PHYSICAL punchline as the hook — someone literally trying to find a fuel cap on the e-cycle, pouring water into a random hole, pointing a petrol nozzle at the battery. SHOW the confusion, don't just SAY it.
3. This should be shot at a petrol bunk, not in an office. The visual contrast of an e-cycle at a petrol pump = instant scroll-stop. Right now the setting kills the concept.

---

### #15. SH-002_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 30/100
**Profile:** BCH 2nd Life (@2nd_hand_bch)
**Duration:** 22.5s
**What I see:** Close-up cycle shots with price overlays (₹18,000). Man in black t-shirt presenting. Alternating between product close-ups and presenter. Standard product showcase format.
**What I hear (Hindi/Kannada):** "Sir, this 2-month old gear cycle... mint condition... twenty-one thousand rupees"

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The quick-cut editing between product and presenter adds some pace — it's not slow. The price overlay is clear and immediate. For 2nd Life's TG (value-hunters), leading with price is correct.
2. But this format is IDENTICAL across all 4 SH videos. No viewer can tell SH-002 apart from SH-003 from SH-006. You need ONE visual differentiator per video — the owner's reaction, a before/after, a test ride.
3. Start with the PRICE, not the product. Flash "₹18,000 — Mint condition" as a FULL SCREEN text for 1 second, THEN show the bike. The number stops scrolls. The bike confirms the number.

---

### #16. SH-003_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 28/100
**Profile:** BCH 2nd Life (@2nd_hand_bch)
**Duration:** 16.9s
**What I see:** Same template as SH-002. Orange/red cycle with price overlay (₹1,500). Quick cuts between product shots and presenter. Standard product showcase.
**What I hear (Tamil):** About cycle pricing

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The price point (₹1,500) is genuinely LOW — that's the scroll-stop, not the cycle itself. Lead with "Rs. 1,500" in giant text, full screen, first frame.
2. Same template problem as all SH videos. The viewer's brain recognizes the format in 0.5 seconds and scrolls past because they've seen it before. Break the pattern — film the cycle outdoors, or have someone TEST RIDE it.
3. At ₹1,500, the hook should be DISBELIEF — "This cycle costs less than your Swiggy bill." Frame the price against something the viewer spends more on daily. Don't just show the price; create a REACTION to it.

---

### #17. SH-004_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 25/100
**Profile:** BCH 2nd Life (@2nd_hand_bch)
**Duration:** 24.3s
**What I see:** Green cycle ("ROADEO HULK" branding visible). Person showing the cycle. Green is visually more striking. Same template — product showcase with model name overlay.
**What I hear (Tamil/Hindi):** About the bike model

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The green "Hulk" cycle is the most visually DISTINCTIVE product across all SH videos — the bright green pops on screen. Use this — match the energy. This is a HULK bike, sell it like a Hulk bike.
2. Same template. Same angle. Same format. Even if the product is different, the CONTENT looks identical. Viewers scroll past patterns they recognize.
3. For a bike called "HULK," the hook should be STRENGTH/POWER themed. Someone standing on it, jumping on it, trying to break it and failing. The name gives you the concept for free — use it.

---

### #18. NXT-002_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 25/100
**Profile:** Next.BLR (@next.blr)
**Duration:** 55.4s
**What I see:** Opens with tire/wheel close-up, then men in checked shirts in store. Kannada text "ಶೇರ್ ಮಾಡಿ" (Share it). Multiple people interacting.
**What I hear (Kannada/Hindi):** Store conversation

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The opening tire close-up is the ONLY visually interesting frame — it's a detail shot that creates a micro-mystery ("what am I looking at?"). But it lasts less than 1 second before cutting to a generic store shot.
2. Multiple people creates energy but energy without DIRECTION is just noise. Who should I look at? What's happening? Give the viewer ONE clear subject in the first frame.
3. The "ಶೇರ್ ಮಾಡಿ" (Share it) text on screen is asking the viewer to do something before giving them a reason to. Never ask for an action before delivering value.

---

### #19. RAL-001_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 25/100
**Profile:** Raleigh x BCH (@raleighxbch)
**Duration:** 59.0s
**What I see:** Two kids standing on a sidewalk outdoors. "ALL FAKE OR NOT?" text overlay. Cars and buildings in background. Kids appear to be talking/presenting.
**What I hear (Tamil):** Kids talking

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. "ALL FAKE OR NOT?" text is the only hook element — it creates a curiosity gap. The concept direction (myth-busting/authenticity) is right for Raleigh's trust-builder identity.
2. But two kids standing on a sidewalk is one of the weakest possible visuals. No action, no movement, no dramatic setting. The text is carrying ALL the weight — the visual carries zero.
3. SHOW "fake vs not" — open with a close-up of someone BENDING a fake cycle part that snaps, then cut to the same test on the Raleigh. Physical proof in the first frame. Don't TALK about fake vs real — DEMONSTRATE it.

---

### #20. SH-006_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 25/100
**Profile:** BCH 2nd Life (@2nd_hand_bch)
**Duration:** 32.7s
**What I see:** Cycle close-ups, blue/teal cycle. Price overlays (₹1,000 range with multiple pricing). Man in black t-shirt presenting. Same exact template as SH-002/003/004.
**What I hear (Hindi/Kannada):** "Customers are coming here... branded cycles"

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The multi-price display (₹1,000 x multiple bikes) could work as a "price wall" concept — flash 5-6 prices in rapid succession to create a volume/value impression.
2. This is the 4th video in the SAME EXACT FORMAT. The template is killing engagement. After SH-002, every subsequent video in this format has diminishing returns — the algorithm knows, the viewer knows.
3. Introduce ONE variable per video — a customer reaction, a test ride, a condition check, a side-by-side comparison. The product can be the same but the STORY around it must change every time.

---

### #21. doodle e cycle gifts.mp4 — SCORE: 22/100
**Profile:** BCH Doodle
**Duration:** 53.6s
**What I see:** A chubby kid (10-12) in blue t-shirt standing in the store. "Weekend Gifts" text overlay. Doodle e-cycles visible behind. Kid appears to be talking/reacting.
**What I hear:** Barely audible

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The kid has an expressive face — use that. But right now he's just standing in the store doing nothing in the first 3 seconds. He needs to DO something physical — grab a gift, react to something, run toward a cycle.
2. "Weekend Gifts" text tells me nothing I'd stop scrolling for. "FREE with every cycle" or "He couldn't believe gift #7" creates curiosity. Be specific, not generic.
3. The store background is the same as 15 other videos. For Doodle content specifically, the visual identity needs to be different — add the rainbow color scheme, different lighting, or shoot in a different section of the store.

---

### #22. mother asking gifts - wattson.mp4 — SCORE: 20/100
**Profile:** Wattson Wheelz (@wattsonwheelz)
**Duration:** 25.7s
**What I see:** Family scene in store — mother and others interacting. "Parents Bonus Deal" text overlay. Multiple people in a standard store setting.
**What I hear:** "Does it give yourself a gift for... then? Madam!"

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. The concept (parent asking about gifts) is conversion-oriented, which is correct for Wattson Wheelz. But the opening is a GROUP of people standing in a store — this is the format of EVERY local business Instagram video.
2. The mother should be the SOLO focus in the first frame — her face, her reaction, her confusion about the gift. Don't dilute the hook with multiple people. One face = one connection.
3. "Parents Bonus Deal" is ad language. Instagram is entertainment, not advertising. Wrap the deal in a STORY — "She came for 1 cycle. She's leaving with 3 gifts she didn't know existed."

---

### #23. yavd bike aa.mp4 — SCORE: 20/100
**Profile:** BCH Main
**Duration:** 24.7s
**What I see:** Two men (blue striped + white shirt) on a street. "Yavd Bike aa" text (Kannada: "Which bike?"). Street/market setting with bikes visible. Casual conversation.
**What I hear:** "Electric starting 25,000 sir. Going, got it now Sam!"

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. "Yavd Bike aa?" (Which bike?) is a decent conversational hook — it mirrors what a real customer asks. But the visual is two regular guys on a street. Nothing to stop a scroll.
2. If the hook is the question "which bike?", the visual should be the ANSWER — start with 5 bikes lined up and a hand pointing at each one rapidly. The visual pace should match the curiosity of the question.
3. The street setting is fine for organic feel, but the camera is at eye-level with no movement. Try a low-angle shot looking UP at the bikes to make them look impressive, or a fast walk-through of the lineup.

---

### #24. EMD-001_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 15/100
**Profile:** Unknown (EMD series)
**Duration:** 32.4s
**What I see:** Store interior. Person standing among e-bikes. "WEEKEND OFFER GIFT" text overlay in red. A person appears to hold up a gift/bag. Generic store footage.
**What I hear (Hindi/Kannada):** About doodle and gifts

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. This is one of the weakest hooks — a person standing in a store with a "WEEKEND OFFER GIFT" banner is what EVERY cycle store posts. There is zero differentiation.
2. If the video is about gifts, START WITH THE GIFTS — a pile of gifts being dumped on a counter, a kid tearing open wrapping, someone catching a gift thrown at them. Physical action with the gifts IS the hook.
3. The "WEEKEND OFFER GIFT" text is invisible to scrollers because it's a phrase they've seen 10,000 times on Instagram. Either be SPECIFIC ("15 free accessories. Today only.") or be VISUAL (show the gifts, don't label them).

---

### #25. kid asking for the gits.mp4 — SCORE: 15/100
**Profile:** BCH Toyz / BCH Main
**Duration:** 29.1s
**What I see:** Opens with what looks like a social media interface. Kid talking to camera. Heart emoji animated. Text overlay about following/subscribing. Multiple kids visible.
**What I hear (Tamil):** "Like, subscribe, share..."

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. Starting with a "like and subscribe" ask is the WORST possible hook on Instagram. The viewer hasn't received any value yet and you're already asking them to do work. This guarantees a swipe-away.
2. The kids have ENERGY — their faces and gestures show they can perform. But you're wasting their talent on a subscribe ask. Give them a SCENE, a SKIT, a CHALLENGE. Let their personality be the hook, not a call-to-action.
3. Delete the first 5 seconds of this video and start from wherever the actual content begins. The "subscribe" ask belongs at the END or in the caption, NEVER at the start.

---

### #26. NXT-001_v1.mp4 — SCORE: 10/100
**Profile:** Next.BLR (@next.blr)
**Duration:** 42.9s
**What I see:** Man in teal t-shirt standing inside the store, talking to camera. "IG GIFT ONLY FOR FOLLOWERS" text overlay. Static camera. Standard talking-head format.
**What I hear:** "Runoff, cycle purchase..."

**Feedback to videographer:**
1. This is the weakest hook in the entire batch. A man standing in a store talking to camera with a promo text overlay is INVISIBLE on Instagram. Every single local business posts this exact format. The scroll time is under 0.5 seconds.
2. "IG GIFT ONLY FOR FOLLOWERS" is a follower-growth tactic, not content. It belongs in a Story or caption, not as the opening frame of a Reel. The algorithm shows Reels to NON-followers first — this hook excludes them entirely.
3. If the message is "follow for a gift," the VIDEO should show someone GETTING the gift and reacting. Show the outcome, not the offer. A kid's face lighting up when they get a surprise gift = hook. A text overlay promising a gift = ad.

---

## SUMMARY DASHBOARD

| Score Range | Count | Videos |
|------------|-------|--------|
| 70-100 (Strong hook) | 1 | night heist police |
| 50-69 (Decent hook) | 3 | dirt pocket bike, kidnap part 1, dancing boy |
| 30-49 (Weak hook) | 10 | TOY-005, TOY-002, TOY-001, self content, TOY-003, EMD-002, Toys 5861, TOY-004, Kerala Bulk, Petrol yelli, SH-002 |
| 10-29 (No hook) | 12 | SH-003, NXT-002, RAL-001, SH-004, SH-006, doodle gifts, mother gifts, yavd bike, EMD-001, kid asking gits, NXT-001 |

**Average hook score across all 26 videos: 33/100**

---

## TOP PATTERNS (What's working)

1. **Night/dark settings** create instant mystery and differentiation (night heist = 72, kidnap = 58)
2. **Physical action from frame 1** beats every static shot (dirt pocket bike = 65, dancing boy = 55)
3. **Genre-mismatch** (crime scene on a cycle purchase) is still the strongest formula
4. **Size contrast** (grown person on tiny pocket bike) is inherently a scroll-stopper
5. **Kids with ENERGY** (dancing, reacting) beat kids standing politely

## BOTTOM PATTERNS (What's killing hooks)

1. **Same template repeated** — SH-002/003/004/006 are the SAME video 4 times. The algorithm and viewers punish repetition.
2. **Talking head in store** — NXT-001 and multiple others open with someone standing in the store talking. This is the default local business format. It's invisible.
3. **"Like/Subscribe/Follow" openers** — Starting with an ask before delivering value guarantees a swipe-away.
4. **Generic text overlays** — "BIG OFFER," "WEEKEND GIFT," "HAPPY CUSTOMER" are phrases people's brains filter out. Specificity and curiosity win.
5. **Store interior as default setting** — 18 out of 26 videos open with the same store background. Nothing distinguishes them from each other.
6. **No physical action** — Only 4 out of 26 videos have any MOVEMENT in the first frame. The other 22 are people standing still.

---

## THE ONE-LINE REALITY CHECK

**Out of 26 edited videos, only 1 has a hook strong enough to compete on Instagram. The other 25 would be scrolled past by a random viewer who doesn't already follow BCH.**

The gap isn't in concepts or products — it's in the first 3 seconds of execution. The videographer needs to treat the first frame like a movie poster: if it doesn't make you stop, nothing after it matters.
