### BD1 — THE BLINDFOLD WALK-IN

**VISUAL HOOK (0-3 sec):**
A kid walks through the BCH entrance BLINDFOLDED. Dark cloth tied around his eyes. Hands reaching out in front, stumbling slightly. Parent behind him, one hand on his shoulder guiding. Staff standing inside, grinning, staying silent. The kid's feet step carefully — he has no idea where he is.

**BODY (3-20 sec):**
Parent positions the kid in front of a wrapped e-cycle. Cake on the counter next to it. "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" banner above. Parent pulls the blindfold off from behind.

Hold the camera TIGHT on the kid's face. Don't cut away. 1 second of confusion. Then recognition. Then his face BREAKS — mouth opens, eyes go wide, hands go to his head. Whatever he does, HOLD THE SHOT. This reaction is the entire video.

Pull back to wide angle. Show the full setup — the wrapped cycle, the cake, the banner, the staff clapping. The kid touches the cycle. Can't believe it's real. Parent's face in the background, watching. That parent face is the second emotional beat.

Staff brings the cake forward. Kid blows candles. Cuts cake ON the cycle seat. Staff cheers. The kid sits on the cycle for the first time. Still inside the store. Huge grin.

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- Sec 0: (no text — let the blindfold create curiosity)
- Sec 5: "His birthday. His surprise."
- Sec 12: "Cake — FREE. Shoot — FREE. Video — FREE."
- Sec 18: CTA

**CLOSE (18-22 sec):**
Founder/staff to camera: "Want the same surprise for YOUR kid? DM 'BIRTHDAY' with the date. 2 days is all we need."

**WHY IT WORKS:** A blindfolded kid stumbling into a store is an instant scroll-stop — "what's happening to this kid?" The genuine reaction moment is the emotional peak. Parents watching this will FEEL the parent behind the kid. The reveal that this is a birthday celebration at a CYCLE STORE (not a party hall) is the unexpected twist. Share trigger: parents send this to spouse saying "let's do this for [kid's name]."

**SHARE TRIGGER:** Parent → spouse: "Can we do this for [kid's name]'s birthday?"
**SAVE TRIGGER:** "Save this — you'll need it before the next birthday."

**PROPS NEEDED:** Dark cloth/towel (have it — prop #6), birthday cake, "Happy Birthday" banner, ribbon for cycle wrapping, party poppers (optional)

### BD2 — THE TWO RECEIPTS

**VISUAL HOOK (0-3 sec):**
A hand SLAMS two paper receipts onto the BCH glass counter. THUD. Camera looking straight down. Two receipts side by side. The hand presses them flat.

**BODY (3-20 sec):**
Camera zooms into LEFT receipt. Red marker circles each line as voiceover/text reads:

LEFT RECEIPT — "Last Year's Birthday":
- Party hall booking: Rs. 8,000
- Decorations + balloons: Rs. 2,000
- Return gifts (20 kids): Rs. 2,500
- Cake: Rs. 1,500
- Photographer (uncle's shaky phone): FREE but unwatchable
- **TOTAL: Rs. 14,000**
- *Gift? Forgot. Bought a Rs. 500 toy last minute.*

Camera pans to RIGHT receipt. Red marker circles:

RIGHT RECEIPT — "This Year at BCH":
- E-cycle: Rs. 15,000 (or EMI Rs. 999/month)
- Cake: **FREE**
- Professional shoot: **FREE**
- Edited birthday video: **FREE**
- Surprise setup at store: **FREE**
- **TOTAL: Rs. 15,000**
- *Gift IS the celebration. The celebration IS the gift.*

Founder's hand picks up both receipts. Holds LEFT receipt up: "3 hours. Forgotten by Monday." Holds RIGHT receipt up: "Ridden to school. Every. Single. Day."

Crumples the left receipt. Drops it. Holds the right one up to camera.

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- Sec 0: "Two birthday plans. Same budget."
- Sec 8: Each line item appears as text overlay matching the voiceover
- Sec 16: "One lasts 3 hours. One lasts 3 YEARS."
- Sec 20: CTA

**CLOSE (20-22 sec):**
CTA text overlay + voiceover.

**WHY IT WORKS:** The physical SLAM of receipts on glass is the hook. Side-by-side comparison is the highest conversion format (proven in Gone in 30 research). The math does the selling — same Rs. 14-15K budget, completely different outcome. The "FREE FREE FREE" stack on the BCH receipt hits the value trigger hard. Parents will SCREENSHOT this or save it. The crumpling of the left receipt is the physical punchline.

**SHARE TRIGGER:** Parent → spouse: "Look at this math. We spent 14K on that party hall last year."
**SAVE TRIGGER:** "I need to save this for comparison before [kid's name]'s birthday."

**PROPS NEEDED:** Two printed receipts (use store printer), red marker (prop #8), BCH glass counter

---

### BD3 — THE FORGOTTEN GIFTS

**VISUAL HOOK (0-3 sec):**
A kid DUMPS an entire bag of old, broken birthday gifts onto the BCH counter. CRASH. Clatter. Pieces scatter. A robot arm rolls off the edge. A cricket bat lands with a thud. Puzzle pieces fly everywhere.

**BODY (3-18 sec):**
Kid picks up each item from the pile, holds it to camera with a deadpan face:

1. Broken toy robot: "Birthday gift. 2022. Lasted 2 days."
2. Cricket bat (dusty, unused): "Birthday gift. 2023. Never played."
3. Board game box (pieces missing): "Birthday gift. 2024. Lost half the pieces by week two."
4. Action figure (still in box, unopened): "Don't even remember which birthday."

He pushes the whole pile aside with one arm sweep. Turns around. Behind him: a shiny e-cycle on the BCH floor.

Walks to it. Puts his hand on the handlebar.

"Birthday gift. 2025. I ride it to school. Every. Single. Day. 8 months and counting."

He sits on it. Looks at the pile of junk on the counter. Looks at camera: "Get your kid something they'll ACTUALLY use."

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- Sec 0: (no text — let the crash create curiosity)
- Sec 4: Item labels appear as he holds each up: "2 days" / "Never used" / "Half missing" / "Forgot"
- Sec 13: "8 months. Every single day."
- Sec 16: CTA

**CLOSE (16-20 sec):**
Text: "Birthday at BCH. Cake FREE. Shoot FREE. Video FREE. DM 'BIRTHDAY' + date."

**WHY IT WORKS:** The physical CRASH of broken gifts onto a counter is visceral and curious. Every parent has bought gifts that collected dust — this is a TG daily-life pain point exaggerated. The deadpan kid energy is comedy. The contrast between a pile of forgotten junk and one cycle used daily is the value argument. No stats needed — the kid's face says it all.

**SHARE TRIGGER:** Parent → other parent: "This is literally every gift we've bought 😂"
**SAVE TRIGGER:** "Saving this before [kid's name]'s birthday so I don't waste money again."

**PROPS NEEDED:** Collection of old/broken toys (ask staff to bring from home or buy cheap from street stall), bag, kid (real walk-in or staff kid)

---

### BD4 — THE 30-MINUTE TIMELAPSE

**VISUAL HOOK (0-3 sec):**
Empty BCH store floor. One bare e-cycle on its stand. No decoration. Nothing. Looks like any regular day. Then — a HAND enters the frame holding a roll of red ribbon. Timelapse starts.

**BODY (3-15 sec):**
Fast-forward timelapse of BCH staff transforming the space:
- Ribbon wrapped around the cycle
- "Happy Birthday" banner hung behind
- Small balloon cluster attached to handlebar
- Cake placed on counter beside the cycle
- Camera/tripod positioned
- Final touches — staff steps back, checks everything

The timelapse compresses 30 minutes into 12 seconds. Empty floor → full birthday surprise setup.

Timelapse STOPS. Regular speed. The setup is ready. Camera pans slowly across: ribbon-wrapped cycle, cake with candles, banner, camera ready.

Staff member to camera: "30 minutes. That's how long it took us. You don't plan a thing. You don't decorate a thing. You don't bake a thing. You just bring your kid."

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- Sec 0: "30 minutes before..."
- Sec 4: Speed counter: "5 min... 10 min... 15 min... 20 min... 25 min... DONE"
- Sec 12: "You plan NOTHING. We plan EVERYTHING."
- Sec 15: CTA

**CLOSE (15-18 sec):**
CTA text + voiceover.

**WHY IT WORKS:** Timelapse transformation content is inherently watchable — the brain wants to see the "before" become the "after." The contrast of empty floor → birthday celebration in 30 minutes makes the service feel EASY. The value proposition is crystal clear: you do nothing, we do everything. This is the "behind the scenes" format that builds trust — they see EXACTLY what BCH does.

**SHARE TRIGGER:** Parent → spouse: "They set all this up in 30 minutes. We should do this."
**SAVE TRIGGER:** "I want to remember this when I plan the birthday."

**PROPS NEEDED:** Ribbon, "Happy Birthday" banner, balloons (small cluster), cake, phone/camera on tripod for timelapse

### BD5 — THE KID'S BOARDROOM PITCH

**VISUAL HOOK (0-3 sec):**
A kid stands in BCH, arms crossed, facing the camera with DEAD SERIOUS energy. Like a CEO about to present quarterly results. One hand adjusts an imaginary tie. He clears his throat. Behind him: e-cycles on display.

**BODY (3-18 sec):**
Kid speaks directly to camera. Fast, confident, rehearsed — like he's been practicing this in the mirror:

"Dad. Mom. Let me present the birthday plan."

*Holds up one finger:*
"YOUR plan last year: Party hall, 8 thousand. Decorations, 1500. Return gifts for 20 kids who aren't even my real friends, 2 thousand. Total damage: 12 thousand. What do I remember from that birthday? Nothing. The cake was dry."

*Holds up second finger:*
"MY plan this year: E-cycle from BCH. I ride to school, tuition, and my ACTUAL friend's house. BCH gives the cake for FREE. They shoot the video for FREE. They edit it with music for FREE. Total: just the cycle. And I USE it every single day."

*Slams hand on the nearest cycle seat like a lawyer resting his case:*
"The defense rests."

Looks at someone off-camera (the parent). Waits. Arms crossed again.

Off-camera parent voice: "...okay."

Kid PUMPS HIS FIST. Celebration. Staff claps.

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- Sec 0: "The Birthday Pitch"
- Sec 6: "Their plan: Rs. 12,000 — forgotten by Monday"
- Sec 12: "My plan: E-cycle + FREE cake + FREE shoot + FREE video"
- Sec 16: CTA

**CLOSE (18-20 sec):**
CTA.

**WHY IT WORKS:** A kid presenting a boardroom pitch is an instant genre mismatch — the seriousness of a business presentation from a 10-year-old is comedy. But the CONTENT of the pitch is real conversion math. Parents watching this will hear their own kid's logic and go "he's got a point." The hand-slam on the cycle seat is the physical punchline. This is entertainment AND conversion in one.

**SHARE TRIGGER:** Kid → parent: "This is me. Watch this." Parent → parent: "This kid is my kid 😂"
**SAVE TRIGGER:** Parents save this because the math is convincing.

**PROPS NEEDED:** A confident kid (real walk-in or rehearsed), e-cycles in background. Nothing else.

---

### BD6 — THE "I SAW YOUR VIDEO"

**VISUAL HOOK (0-3 sec):**
A parent BURSTS through the BCH door holding their phone up, screen facing the staff. Walking fast. Urgent energy. Almost running. "I SAW YOUR VIDEO."

**BODY (3-18 sec):**
Parent, slightly out of breath, shows the phone to BCH staff (we don't need to show the phone screen — just the parent's energy and the staff's reaction):

"My daughter's birthday is Saturday. I saw the video where you did the cake, the surprise, the whole thing. I want EXACTLY that. Can you do it?"

Staff, calm, smiling: "Sir, when's the birthday?"

"Saturday."

"Today is Wednesday. That's 3 days. We need 2. You're perfect."

Staff walks the parent through the store, showing cycles: "Pick the cycle. We handle everything else. Cake is on us. We shoot the whole celebration. Our editor turns it into a video with music. Your daughter walks in, sees this—" *gestures to a demo setup* "—and her face does the rest."

Parent: "That's it? I don't bring decorations? I don't bring a cake?"

Staff: "You bring your daughter. We bring everything else."

Parent's face: relief. Like a weight lifted. "Done. This one." Points at a cycle.

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- Sec 0: (no text — let the burst-in create urgency)
- Sec 5: "3 days before the birthday..."
- Sec 10: "Cake — we handle it. Shoot — we handle it. Video — we handle it."
- Sec 16: CTA

**CLOSE (18-22 sec):**
Founder/staff to camera: "This happens every week. A parent sees our video. Walks in. We plan their kid's birthday in 2 days. Want the same? DM 'BIRTHDAY' with the date."

**WHY IT WORKS:** The parent bursting through the door with phone in hand is physical urgency that hooks. This format is SOCIAL PROOF — showing that other people are ALREADY doing this because of BCH's content. The "I saw your video" line directly communicates that this content works. The staff calmly walking through the process answers every question a new viewer would have. The parent's relief face ("That's it?") mirrors what the viewer is feeling.

**SHARE TRIGGER:** Parent → spouse: "We should do this. It's that easy."
**SAVE TRIGGER:** "Saving this so I remember to DM them before the birthday."

**PROPS NEEDED:** A parent actor (real customer is BEST — capture this when it actually happens), phone in hand.

**PRODUCTION NOTE:** This will happen organically. When a parent ACTUALLY walks in saying they saw the video, be ready to capture it. Keep a camera accessible at all times for these moments.

---

### BD7 — THE UNCUT REACTION (Template for Real Birthdays)

**VISUAL HOOK (0-3 sec):**
CLOSE-UP of a kid's face. TIGHT. Just eyes, nose, mouth. Eyes are closed or covered by parent's hands from behind. Slow motion starts. The hands pull away. 1 second of blankness. Then — the face CHANGES. Eyes widen. Mouth opens. Whatever happens next, happens. This is real. No script.

**BODY (3-15 sec):**
HOLD on the face for a full 3-4 seconds. Don't cut. Don't move the camera. Let the raw reaction breathe. No background music for these 4 seconds — just the real audio: gasp, scream, silence, laughter, crying, whatever comes.

THEN pull back to wide angle. Reveal the full BCH setup — decorated cycle, cake, banner, staff standing around grinning. The kid runs to the cycle / hugs the parent / freezes in shock — whatever is REAL.

Music kicks in NOW. Emotional BGM. Slow motion of the kid touching the cycle for the first time. Parent's face in the background. Staff applauding.

Final shot: kid on the cycle inside the store. Biggest smile.

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- Sec 0: (NO text for first 5 seconds — the face IS the content)
- Sec 7: "This is what a birthday at BCH looks like."
- Sec 10: "Cake — included. Shoot — included. Video — included."
- Sec 13: CTA

**CLOSE (15-18 sec):**
CTA.

**WHY IT WORKS:** A kid's genuine surprise face is the most emotionally powerful content BCH can produce. This is already their #1 performing format. The key is the TIGHT close-up and the UNCUT hold — no fast cuts, no editing tricks. The raw reaction sells itself. This script exists as a TEMPLATE to use every time a real birthday customer comes in.

**SHARE TRIGGER:** "Oh my god, his FACE." → forward to every parent friend.
**SAVE TRIGGER:** "I want this for my kid's birthday."

**PRODUCTION NOTES:**
- ALWAYS have two camera angles ready: one TIGHT on the kid's face, one WIDE for the reveal
- Start recording BEFORE the reveal — you can't re-do a genuine reaction
- Let the reaction happen. Don't direct the kid. Don't tell them to "act surprised."
- Capture the parent's face too — that's the second emotional beat
- Get permission to post AFTER the moment, not before (don't break the surprise)

---

### BD8 — THE CALENDAR CIRCLE

**VISUAL HOOK (0-3 sec):**
A wall calendar hanging at BCH. A hand grabs a FAT RED MARKER and CIRCLES a date — aggressive, big circles, the marker squeaks on the paper. Below the circle, the hand writes in all caps: **"BIRTHDAY."** The pen drops onto the counter with a clatter.

**BODY (3-18 sec):**
Staff member picks up the calendar, holds it to camera:

"See this date? That's 2 days from now. Someone's kid is turning 10."

Cut to: BCH staff in action. One person on the phone ordering a cake. Another wrapping a cycle in ribbon. Another hanging a banner. Camera being positioned.

"Right now, the parent is at work. Not stressing about party halls. Not buying decorations. Not fighting with a balloon guy. Not bribing their brother-in-law to bring a camera."

Cut to: finished setup. Cycle wrapped, cake ready, banner up, camera rolling.

"Because we're doing all of it. In here. In 2 days. They just walk in with their kid."

Final shot: the circled calendar date, camera pushes in close.

"What's YOUR kid's birthday date?"

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- Sec 0: (let the aggressive red circle create tension)
- Sec 5: "2 days before the birthday..."
- Sec 10: "No party hall. No decorations. No stress."
- Sec 14: "Cake — on us. Shoot — on us. Video — on us."
- Sec 17: CTA

**CLOSE (17-20 sec):**
CTA.

**WHY IT WORKS:** The aggressive red marker on a calendar is a physical action with sound — the squeaking marker, the clatter of the pen. Circling dates in red is a universal visual for urgency/deadlines. The body answers the parent's biggest objection: "birthday planning is a headache." BCH's answer: "we handle everything. You don't lift a finger." The list of things the parent DOESN'T have to do (no party hall, no decorations, no balloon guy, no bribing relatives for camera) is relatable comedy and value stacking at the same time.

**SHARE TRIGGER:** Parent → spouse: "Let's just do this instead of the whole party headache."
**SAVE TRIGGER:** "Saving this — [kid's name]'s birthday is in [X] weeks."

**PROPS NEEDED:** Wall calendar, red marker (fat tip — prop #8), ribbon, banner, cake (or stand-in)

---

### BD9 — THE CAKE ON THE CYCLE

**VISUAL HOOK (0-3 sec):**
A birthday cake sits ON TOP of an e-cycle seat. Candles lit. Flickering. Inside BCH. The camera is LOW, looking up at the cake on the cycle. Candles dancing. It's an absurd image — a birthday cake on a bicycle seat, inside a store.

**BODY (3-18 sec):**
A kid appears. Walks up to the cycle. Looks at the cake. Looks at the cycle. Looks at the cake again. His brain is processing: "Wait... is the cake AND the cycle for me?"

Parent behind him nods.

Kid blows out the candles. Staff cheers. He cuts the cake RIGHT THERE on the cycle seat. First slice goes to the parent. Second slice goes to the staff member who wrapped the cycle.

Then he looks down. Runs his hand over the handlebar. Squeezes the brake. Sits on the seat (cake has been moved to counter). First time on HIS cycle. The grin.

Founder/staff to camera: "Every birthday at BCH. You buy the cycle. We bring the cake. We shoot the whole thing. We edit it into a video your kid will watch 50 times. And all of THIS—" *gestures to the setup* "—costs you ZERO extra."

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- Sec 0: (no text — the image of cake-on-cycle is the hook)
- Sec 5: "The cake AND the cycle? Both for me?"
- Sec 10: "Cake — FREE. Shoot — FREE. Video — FREE."
- Sec 15: "ZERO extra cost."
- Sec 17: CTA

**CLOSE (17-20 sec):**
CTA.

**WHY IT WORKS:** A birthday cake on a bicycle seat with candles lit — inside a store — is an image people haven't seen before. It's unusual enough to stop the scroll: "why is there a cake on a cycle?" The kid's double-take ("both for me?") is the emotional moment. Cutting cake on a cycle seat is a memorable visual that people will RETELL — "bro they cut the cake ON the cycle seat." This passes the Chai Test.

**SHARE TRIGGER:** "Bro, they cut the birthday cake ON the cycle 😂" → forward for the unusual visual.
**SAVE TRIGGER:** "This is a cute idea for [kid's name]'s birthday."

**PROPS NEEDED:** Birthday cake (with candles), lighter, e-cycle. That's it.

### BD10 — THE 3 PACKAGES

**VISUAL HOOK (0-3 sec):**
Three printed cards SLAPPED onto the BCH counter one by one. SLAP — "CLASSIC." SLAP — "PREMIUM." SLAP — "GRAND." Each card lands with a thud. Camera above, looking down at the three cards on the counter.

**BODY (3-25 sec):**
Founder/staff walks through each package, pointing at the card and showing the corresponding setup:

**CLASSIC (Free with every birthday purchase):**
*Cut to: simple setup — cycle with ribbon, cake on counter, phone camera ready.*
"You buy the cycle. We wrap it. We bring the cake. We shoot the surprise. We edit the video with music. You walk out with the cycle AND the memory. Cost of all this? Zero. It's included."

**PREMIUM (Rs. 500–1,000):**
*Cut to: upgraded setup — full decoration with balloons and banner, themed cake, better camera angle, extended video edit.*
"You want it bigger? Balloons, banner, a cake that actually matches the theme. Our videographer shoots it properly. You get a 60-second edited reel with music — ready to post on YOUR Instagram. Starting Rs. 500."

**GRAND (Custom quote):**
*Cut to: the full experience — elaborate decoration, custom cycle color wrapping, professional multi-angle shoot, social media-ready video, the whole nine yards.*
"You want the FULL thing? Event-level decoration. Custom setup. Multi-angle video. A reel so good your entire family WhatsApp group will ask where you did it. We send you a quote based on what you want. Your budget, your call."

Staff holds up all three cards: "Classic, Premium, Grand. Every birthday gets at least the Classic. Cake, shoot, video. ALL free. The rest is up to you."

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- Sec 0: "3 Birthday Plans. Pick yours."
- Sec 6: "CLASSIC — FREE with purchase | Cake + Shoot + Video"
- Sec 13: "PREMIUM — from Rs. 500 | Decorations + Extended Video"
- Sec 19: "GRAND — Custom Quote | Full Event Setup"
- Sec 23: CTA

**CLOSE (23-27 sec):**
CTA.

**WHY IT WORKS:** The three-card SLAP is a physical hook with rhythm — viewers wait for each card. The tiered pricing makes it accessible (everyone gets the Classic free) while upselling (Premium and Grand exist for those who want more). This directly addresses the user's idea of 3 plans. The visual of showing the ACTUAL setup for each tier makes it concrete — not just words, but what it LOOKS like. Parents will save this to compare options.

**SHARE TRIGGER:** Parent → spouse: "Look, they have 3 plans. The free one is already good."
**SAVE TRIGGER:** Instant save — this is a price/comparison card. People bookmark decision content.

**PROPS NEEDED:** Three printed cards (CLASSIC / PREMIUM / GRAND), decorations for each tier demo, cake

### The Flywheel:
Birthday celebration content → goes viral → new parents see it → DM "BIRTHDAY" → more celebrations → more content → more viral → more parents...

**This is a self-feeding content machine. Every real birthday at BCH creates the next piece of content that brings the next birthday customer.**

*10 scripts. All at BCH store. All conversion-focused. All designed to trigger "I want this for MY kid's birthday." The genuine reaction content (BD7) is the engine — every real birthday creates the content that feeds the next one.*
