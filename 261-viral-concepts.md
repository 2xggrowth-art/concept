### C6. THE GPS STALKER MOM

A mother waves goodbye as her kid rides away on the e-cycle for the first time. Big smile. "Have fun!" The SECOND the kid turns the corner — her face changes. She whips out her phone. Live GPS tracking. Speed monitor. She's following every move like a spy movie. Split screen: kid riding freely, laughing / mom zoomed into a map, biting her nails. The kid stops at a friend's house. Mom zooms in to street level. Calls immediately: "Did you reach?" Kid: "Mom, it's been 2 minutes." She knows. She saw. But she called anyway. Because she's a mother.

**Why it works:** First frame is a smiling mother waving goodbye — the split to phone stalking is the pattern interrupt. The contradiction of "letting go" while tracking every meter is every Indian mother's reality. The split-screen makes the comedy visual. The call at 2 minutes is the punchline everyone's mother has done. This shows the e-cycle is safe enough even for the most paranoid mom.

### C7. THE SAFETY INTERROGATION

A mother sits across from the BCH salesman like it's a police interrogation. Single harsh light above. She leans forward. "What happens if he rides too fast?" "Speed lock at 25 kmph, ma'am." She writes it down. "What if he falls?" "The cycle weighs 18kg. Easy to control." She writes. "What if it rains?" "Water-resistant motor and brakes." She writes. "What if the battery dies mid-ride?" "It becomes a regular cycle. He pedals home." She writes. Ten questions in, the salesman is sweating. Twenty questions in, he's loosened his collar. By question 23, he's standing, pacing, like he's defending a PhD thesis. She finishes. Folds her paper. Looks at her husband: "He passed." The salesman COLLAPSES into his chair with relief. The kid who's been hiding behind a display cycle SPRINTS out screaming.

**Why it works:** First frame is a harsh-light interrogation setup with a mother leaning in like a cop — the viewer thinks this is a crime scene. The physical comedy of the salesman sweating, loosening his collar, and finally collapsing is the visual escalation. The kid hiding behind a display and sprinting out screaming is the physical payoff. This is C3's interrogation energy but with a tighter, more dramatic visual setup. Easy to shoot: one table, one light, two chairs.

### C8. THE SLIPPER THROW

A mother is in the kitchen cooking. Her kid walks by staring at his phone, about to walk INTO the open kitchen door. She THROWS her slipper — it lands right in front of his feet with a SMACK. He freezes. Looks up for the first time in 20 minutes. She points the ladle at him: "The last time you saw sunlight was Sankranti. It's JUNE." He opens his mouth. She raises the slipper. He closes his mouth. She doesn't yell. She picks up a BCH brochure from the kitchen counter — she's been researching for weeks in secret. Slides it across to him. "This weekend. You, me, and your father. No arguments." She picks her slipper back up. Goes back to cooking. He stares at the brochure. Knows better than to say no.

**Why it works:** First frame is a flying slipper — the most iconic Indian mother visual in existence. EVERY desi kid knows the chappal. The slipper landing in front of his feet as a pattern interrupt is physical comedy that crosses every demographic. "The last time you saw sunlight was Sankranti" is specific and funny. This is an Indian mother doing what Indian mothers do: solving problems with a chappal and zero negotiation. Easy to shoot, universally relatable, zero budget.

### C10. THE RUSTY-TO-SHINY EXCHANGE

A kid rides up to BCH on the most beaten-up, rusty, squeaky regular cycle you've ever seen. Chain hanging off. One pedal missing. Tires nearly flat. Every rotation makes a dying sound. He parks it outside. The cycle literally leans and almost falls. He walks in. Cut to: he walks OUT on a brand-new e-cycle. Silent motor. Clean frame. LED lights. He rides off without looking back. The old cycle sits there, abandoned. A timelapse shows dust collecting on it. Then a BCH staff member picks it up with a trade-in tag: "Rs. 5,000-15,000 toward your new e-cycle."

**Why it works:** The visual of the most pathetic cycle on earth arriving at the store — squeaking, falling apart — vs the gleaming e-cycle riding out is the ultimate glow-up content. No words needed. The sound design alone (squeaky death rattle vs silent electric hum) tells the story. The trade-in tag at the end turns it from entertainment into a conversion prompt.

## CATEGORY 3: OFFER (10 videos)

### O1. THE CHAI MATH

A father at a roadside chai stall CRUSHES his empty paper cup and THROWS it into a bin 10 feet away. Perfect shot. His friend claps. He does this every morning. Rs. 20 a cup. Every single day. Then the friend pulls out a calculator: Rs. 20 x 365 = Rs. 7,300/year. He stares. A second line appears on screen: "E-Cycle EMI: Rs. 999/month. That's less than 2 chai per day." His face changes. He's been spending more on TEA than it would cost to give his kid freedom. The stall guy pours another chai. He stares at it. Pushes it back. "Cancel." Walks to BCH. Pays the first EMI. Comes home. His kid is on the e-cycle. He makes chai at home that night. Saves Rs. 20.

**Why it works:** First frame is a man doing a perfect paper-cup throw into a bin — a satisfying physical action that hooks attention. Every viewer watches to see if it lands. The math reveal that follows turns casual entertainment into a financial gut-punch: an e-cycle EMI costs less than daily chai. The father pushing back the next chai ("Cancel") is the physical decision moment. Shareable as financial content AND emotional content.

### O5. THE 20-MINUTE RICH DAD

A man walks into BCH. Full South Indian rich-dad energy — thick gold chain on neck, gold rings on every other finger, Reddy-style crisp shirt, sunglasses on. Phone to his ear. Barely looks around. His kid is SPRINTING between cycles, touching everything, eyes huge. The salesman approaches, starts explaining features. The dad holds up ONE finger without looking — the gold ring GLINTS in the store light — "one minute." Finishes his call. Looks at his kid's face. Looks at the price. Doesn't blink. "Pack it." The salesman hasn't finished his first sentence. The kid's jaw drops — he was prepared for a 2-hour negotiation. Dad swipes his card. Signs. Done. Total time in store: 20 minutes including billing. Walking out, the kid whispers: "That's IT?" Dad adjusts his gold chain: "That's it." He's not buying a cycle. He's buying his kid's happiness, and the price is nothing to a man who wears that much gold.

**Why it works:** First frame is a man DRIPPING in gold walking into a cycle store — the viewer's eyes go straight to the chains and rings. The Reddy-style rich dad look is instantly recognizable to every South Indian. The casual "pack it" without hearing the pitch is aspirational comedy amplified by the gold. The kid's disbelief ("That's IT?") mirrors the viewer's disbelief. This is EXACTLY how the 37% of BCH's premium customers shop. The gold chain adjust at the end is the chef's kiss.

### O6. THE GUILT GALLERY

A father sits alone in a room. Looks directly at the camera. No cuts. No background music. Just his face. He opens with: "Sir, I spoiled my own kid." Pause. "Every birthday — iPad. Every Diwali — PlayStation. Good grades — phone upgrade. Festival — smartwatch. EVERY gift I gave him was a screen. I created the addiction. I funded it. Gift by gift. Year by year. And then one day I realized — my son doesn't look up anymore. He doesn't look at me. He doesn't look outside. He looks DOWN. At the screen I put in his hands." He takes a breath. "So I went to BCH. Bought the first gift that takes him AWAY from a screen instead of toward one. It's not a purchase. It's an apology." He looks at the camera one last time. Behind him on the wall: a single photo of his kid on the e-cycle, riding, smiling, looking UP.

**Why it works:** First frame is a father looking DIRECTLY at camera saying "I spoiled my own kid." Those five words stop every parent cold. The direct-to-camera confession format is raw and uncommon — brands don't do this. The guilt of funding screen addiction gift by gift is a truth every parent carries. The final image — the kid looking UP instead of down — is the visual resolution. This is a 60-second piece that will be shared by every parent who's ever bought their kid an iPad for their birthday.

### O7. THE BIRTHDAY SURPRISE

A living room. Something large covered in a RED cloth. Party poppers loaded on both sides. Parents behind the camera, barely holding it together. The kid walks in from school. Sees the red cloth. Eyes go wide. He reaches for it — the parents BLAST the party poppers. BANG. Confetti everywhere. Streamers flying. The kid JUMPS back, startled, then laughs. He PULLS the red cloth off — an e-cycle underneath. The founder steps in: "If you want the same celebration for your kid's birthday, don't waste Rs. 50,000 on a party hall. Buy an e-cycle. We handle end-to-end: birthday cake, gift wrapping, doorstep delivery. Comment 'BIRTHDAY' for details." The kid is already on the cycle, riding circles through the confetti.

**Why it works:** First frame is party poppers EXPLODING — confetti, streamers, BANG. Visceral. Physical. Impossible to scroll past. The red cloth reveal is dramatic and satisfying. The founder's direct pitch is punchy and actionable — it converts celebration energy into a CTA. "Don't waste 50K on a party" is a line every budget parent thinks. The kid riding through confetti is the closing visual. Simple setup: red cloth, party poppers, one e-cycle.

### O8. THE GIFT DEMAND KID

BCH store. A kid walks in and looks straight at the camera: "Bro, I followed you. Where are my gifts?" HARD CUT. Same kid to the salesman: "Dad cleared the payment. Where are my gifts?" HARD CUT. The kid stands at the counter. Points at accessories one by one. "Helmet? That's one." The salesman places it on the counter. "Lock? Two." Placed. "Pump? Three." Placed. "LED light? Four." He keeps going. Bell. Toolkit. Bottle holder. Mudguard. Reflector. Stand. Phone mount. Gloves. Bag. Chain guard. Service card. By gift 15, the counter is OVERFLOWING. The kid turns to the camera: "Bro, 15 FREE gifts. Just buy the cycle." He leans on the e-cycle behind him, arms crossed, grinning. He's sold it better than any ad could.

**Why it works:** First frame is a kid looking AT the camera saying "Where are my gifts?" with genuine kid energy — it mimics the comment-section language of viral videos. The spoken hook is immediate and crazy. The rapid-fire gift stacking on the counter builds visual momentum — 15 gifts piling up is satisfying to watch. This is BCH's proven gold format (kid demanding gifts, already shot and confirmed killer content) turned into a structured product showcase. The kid sells the offer with more conviction than any script because he's a REAL kid being a real kid.

### O9. THE PIGGYBACK EMI

A father gives his kid a piggyback ride down the street. Both laughing. 50 meters. 100 meters. The father starts slowing. His back CRACKS. He's DONE. He puts the kid down, hands on knees, panting: "Beta, you're too heavy now." The kid looks disappointed. The father stands up straight. Points at BCH across the street: "What if I told you there's something that carries you AND doesn't complain about your weight?" They walk in. Rs. 999/month EMI. The kid gets on the e-cycle. The father watches his kid ride without needing to be carried. He rubs his back. Smiles. The piggyback days are over. But the ride isn't.

**Why it works:** First frame is a father struggling to piggyback his growing kid — physical, relatable, funny. The BACK CRACK sound is the comedy beat. The panting, hands-on-knees moment is every dad over 35. The transition from "I carry you" to "this carries you" is the emotional bridge. The EMI reveal (Rs. 999) feels like nothing compared to the back pain he just experienced. Simple props: a road, a dad, a kid. Zero budget.

### O10. THE STORE WALKTHROUGH WITH LIVE PRICE TAGS

A kid BURSTS through the BCH store entrance at full sprint, arms out like an airplane, almost knocking over a display stand. His parents chase behind: "SLOW DOWN!" But he's gone — sprinting through the store SLAPPING every e-cycle like it's a candy store. Every cycle he slaps, a price tag pops up on screen — not the full price, but the DAILY cost. He slaps the first one: "Rs. 33/day." Slaps the premium one: "Rs. 66/day." Slaps the mid-range: "Rs. 33/day." A text bar runs at the bottom: "Less than a plate of idli." "Less than a cup of coffee." "Less than your kid's daily chips packet." The kid's face: he doesn't understand the math. He just wants the cycle. The parent behind him, still catching their breath: they understand perfectly.

**Why it works:** First frame is a kid SPRINTING into a store and almost crashing into a display — physical chaos that hooks instantly. The slapping of each cycle makes the price tag reveal feel like a game. The "daily cost" reframe is psychologically powerful — Rs. 25,000 feels expensive but Rs. 33/day feels like nothing. Comparing it to idli, coffee, and chips packets makes the viewer realize they spend MORE on forgettable snacks than on their kid's freedom.

## CATEGORY 4: PROBLEM-LED (10 videos)
**Goal:** Surface pain points so vividly the viewer MUST act

### P5. THE MOMMY DROP-OFF

A car pulls up to a friend's birthday party. A 15-year-old climbs out of the BACK SEAT. His mom waves: "Have fun beta! Call me when to pick up!" Three of his friends arrive on their own e-cycles. In a line. Like a squad. They park together. Walk in together. Everyone watches them. The car-dropped kid watches from the gate. He arrived like a child being delivered. They arrived like they own the streets. At the party, someone asks: "How did you come?" He says: "My mom dropped me." Silence. Quick topic change. That silence after "my mom dropped me" is the loudest sound in the video.

**Why it works:** First frame is a 15-year-old climbing out of the back seat of his mom's car at a party — every teenager's nightmare. The contrast with friends arriving independently on e-cycles is status violence. The party question "how did you come?" turning into an embarrassing confession is specific and painful. This isn't about the e-cycle. It's about independence vs dependence at an age where that gap defines your social life.

**TG:** Kids 14-17

### P8. THE DOCTOR'S ADVICE LOOP

Doctor's office. "You need 30 minutes of daily exercise." The man nods seriously. Cut: he's on the couch. "Any activity — walking, running, cycling." Cut: he's ordering food on Swiggy. "I mean it this time." Cut: he's winded climbing one flight of stairs, hands on knees. "Your reports are getting worse." Cut: he's googling "exercise without actually exercising." The doctor's voice plays on loop while the man does the OPPOSITE of every instruction. Then his wife silently wheels an e-cycle into the living room. Places it in front of the TV. He looks at it. Looks at the couch. Looks at it again. Gets on. Because the pedal assist doesn't feel like punishment. The doctor's loop finally stops.

**Why it works:** The comedy loop of doctor's advice immediately followed by the opposite behavior is a format that rewards rewatching. Each cut gets funnier. The wife silently placing the e-cycle in front of the TV — no words, no lecture, just ACTION — is the smartest thing in the video. The line "pedal assist doesn't feel like punishment" is the e-cycle's entire value proposition for fitness adults in one sentence.

### I10. THE TWO ARRIVALS

Guy 1 BURSTS through the office door at 9:01 AM. Shirt DRENCHED in sweat. He THROWS his bag on the floor. COLLAPSES face-first onto his desk. Arms spread. Doesn't move. A colleague walks past: "Rough morning?" He doesn't lift his head. Just raises one finger. Muffled voice into the desk: "Traffic." 3 seconds later — Guy 2 walks through the SAME door. Removes his helmet. Shirt crisp. Breathing easy. Slight smile. Sits at the desk RIGHT NEXT to the collapsed guy. Opens his laptop. Starts working. Same office. Same morning. Same role. Same salary. Same distance from home. One man looks like he survived a war. The other looks like he went for a morning walk. The boss walks by. Sees Guy 1 still face-down on his desk. Sees Guy 2 already deep into work. Guess who gets the 10 AM client meeting?

**Why it works:** First frame is a grown man COLLAPSING face-first onto his desk and THROWING his bag on the floor at 9 AM — dramatic, physical, instantly relatable to every office worker. The muffled "traffic" spoken INTO the desk is dark comedy. Guy 2 entering the same door 3 seconds later looking fresh is the visual slap. The boss choosing between a face-down zombie and an already-working cyclist is the punchline with real career stakes. How you ARRIVE determines how you PERFORM.

**TG:** Commuters

## CATEGORY 6: BEHAVIOUR TARGETING (10 videos)

**Tone:** Gamified, community energy, challenge-driven

### B1. THE ODOMETER BIRTHDAY PARTY

A kid obsessively watches his e-cycle's odometer. 100km — takes a screenshot. 500km — takes a photo with the cycle. 1,000km — he throws a full BIRTHDAY PARTY for the cycle. Balloon tied to the handlebar. A paper crown on the seat. He lights a candle on the dashboard. His family gathers around reluctantly. He sings happy birthday. Blows out the candle. His dad: "Beta, it's a cycle." Kid: "It's not just a cycle, Appa. We've been through 1,000km together." He cuts a small cake. The cycle's "birthday" is the most absurd and lovable celebration a kid could throw.

**Why it works:** First frame is a lit candle on an e-cycle seat with a paper crown — the viewer needs to know what's happening. A kid celebrating 1,000km like a relationship milestone is comedic but genuine. This GAMIFIES the riding habit — viewers will check their own km and think about milestones. The dad's exasperation adds humor. The "we've been through 1,000km together" line makes the cycle a character, not an object. Other kids will want to hit 1,000km just to do this.

**TG:** Gold 20% Kids

## CATEGORY 7: CONTEXTUAL — LIFE EVENTS (10 videos)

### L4. THE FIRST PAYCHECK DAD

A father gets a new job after months of struggle. Better salary. First paycheck hits his account. He looks at the number. Doesn't tell anyone. Goes to BCH after work. Alone. Buys the e-cycle. Puts it in his car. Drives home. Parks as usual. Walks in as usual. Dinner as usual. Doesn't say a word. After dinner, casually: "Beta, go check outside." The kid walks to the car. Opens the boot. The e-cycle. The kid looks back at his father. The father shrugs: "First paycheck." The first thing he bought with his new salary wasn't for himself. It was for his kid. And he didn't make a ceremony of it. That quiet generosity — the shrug — is what fathers are made of.

**Why it works:** The setup looks like a "new job" motivational video — the paycheck reveal could go anywhere. The fact that his FIRST purchase is for his kid, not himself, is the emotional core. The casual reveal — no ceremony, no build-up, just "go check outside" — is how real Indian fathers give gifts. They don't make it dramatic. They make it look easy even when it wasn't. The shrug at the end is the most Indian father gesture possible.

### L6. THE 2-YEAR ASK TIMELINE

A kid creates a visual timeline of every time he asked for an e-cycle. Age 12: screenshot of a text to dad — "Appa plsss." Ignored. Age 13: showed YouTube videos to mom at dinner. "We'll see." Age 13.5: printed out BCH website specs and left them on dad's pillow. "Not now." Age 14: drew a picture of himself on an e-cycle for art class. Teacher gave it an A+. Parents gave it a "hmm." Age 14.5: made a PowerPoint presentation with ROI calculations. "You're too young." Age 15: birthday. He's given up asking. His parents walk in with the key. 2 years. Every creative method failed. Except patience. He didn't convince them. They convinced themselves.

**Why it works:** The timeline of escalating attempts — text, video, printed specs, drawing, POWERPOINT — is comedy that builds. Each rejection gets funnier. But the payoff is different from expected: the parents didn't cave to pressure. They decided when THEY were ready. The kid's PowerPoint with ROI is the standout visual — a teenager presenting a business case for a bicycle is absurd and hilarious. The final "he gave up, and that's when they bought it" is a parenting truth.

### L7. THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE

First day of college. A montage of arrivals: a kid gets out of an auto. Another from a bus. A car pulls up, mom waves from inside. Then — the sound of an e-cycle. A kid rides up, parks, takes off his helmet, walks in. He's not the richest, tallest, or most popular. But he's the kid who arrived ON HIS OWN TERMS. Inside, everyone is introducing themselves. "Where are you from?" "What stream?" And the one that matters at 18: "How did you get here?" "I rode." First day, first impression, first identity statement. At 18, how you arrive is who you are.

**Why it works:** College first day is a life event with massive emotional charge. The montage of dependent arrivals (auto, bus, mom's car) vs the independent e-cycle arrival is a status hierarchy established in 10 seconds. "I rode" as a two-word identity statement is powerful. This positions the e-cycle as a college-readiness tool — it's not about the vehicle, it's about the independence signal it sends on day one.

### L9. THE DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION ADDITION

A 40-year-old man. Doctor's office after a health scare. The doctor writes prescriptions: medicines, diet restrictions, "30 minutes daily exercise — non-negotiable." The man takes the prescription home. Sticks it on the fridge. That night, he takes a pen and adds ONE line in his own handwriting below the doctor's writing: "E-Cycle — 30 min daily." 6 months later: same doctor's office. Better reports. Lower BP. Lost weight. The doctor looks at the prescription on the desk. Sees the handwritten addition. Looks up: "You actually did it?" The man: "The pedal assist helped." The doctor nods: "I'm prescribing this to all my patients now." Takes a photo of the prescription.

**Why it works:** The doctor's prescription is a trusted format — viewer takes it seriously from frame one. The patient ADDING his own line to a medical document is an act of agency that's both funny and inspiring. The 6-month follow-up with improved reports is the proof. The doctor photographing the self-prescribed line to share with other patients is the ultimate endorsement. This positions the e-cycle as a medical tool, not a toy — which is the belief shift fitness adults need.

### X1. REDDY ANNA VISITS BCH *(Cultural Property + Status Mismatch)*

**Format:** Comedy skit, character-driven, Kanglish dialogue
**Talent:** 3 males (Reddy + Sidekick + Rival)
**Reference:** Vi Network "Reddy is Back" format — comedy skit disguised as an ad

---

**VISUAL & ACTION** | **AUDIO & DIALOGUE**

**00:00 – 00:04 (THE HOOK)**

A car/auto pulls up outside BCH. A man (Reddy) steps out in SLOW MOTION — white shirt unbuttoned at the top, thick gold chains on neck, gold rings, black sunglasses. He adjusts his chains. Camera at LOW ANGLE looking UP at him. | *(Heavy bass BGM — "mass" entry music)*

**Text overlay:** *Reddy is back in business*

**00:05 – 00:10**

Reddy walks into BCH with full swagger. A sidekick rushes ahead wiping the seat of a chair with his sleeve before Reddy sits. Reddy sits with legs crossed in the MIDDLE of the showroom floor. Arms on the chair like a throne. Customers stare. | **Sidekick:** "Baas, sit baas."

**Reddy:** *(Says nothing. Just adjusts sunglasses. Power move.)*

**00:11 – 00:18**

A rival walks in PUSHING a squeaky, rusted, cheap cycle. The chain is hanging off. One pedal missing. He pushes it proudly toward Reddy. | **Rival:** "Baas! Look what I got. Online shopping. Heavy discount!"

**Reddy:** *(Looks at the cycle. Looks at the rival. Back at the cycle.)*

**00:19 – 00:26**

Reddy stands up slowly. Walks to the cheap cycle. Flicks the chain with one finger — it FALLS OFF and hits the floor with a clang. He wipes his finger on his sidekick's shirt. | **Reddy:** "Discount-ah? Without service, you are NERVOUS."

**Sidekick:** "Punch-ah?"

**Reddy:** "Logic, baas. Logic."

**00:27 – 00:34**

Reddy walks to a premium e-cycle on display. SLAPS the seat confidently. Runs his hand across the frame. | **Reddy:** "Look at this chain." *(Points at the broken one on the floor)* "Loose like your brain."

*(Points at the e-cycle)* "And look at THIS. Silent motor. Speed lock. 25 years of BCH."

**00:35 – 00:42**

Rival tries to argue back. Reddy raises one finger — silence. | **Rival:** "But baas, price—"

**Reddy:** "Quality idre, price matter aagalla." *(If there is quality, price doesn't matter.)*

**Rival:** "But—"

**Reddy:** "How many people trust your online shop?"

**Rival:** "..."

**Reddy:** "BCH — 1 lakh customers. Yelahanka to whole Bangalore. 25 years. You are 25 DAYS."

**00:43 – 00:50**

Reddy sits ON the e-cycle like it's his throne. Sidekick fans him with a brochure. The rival stares at his broken cycle on the floor. | **Reddy:** "How Reddy runs Bangalore, BCH runs the cycling world. Only for legends."

**00:51 – 00:58 (THE OUTRO)**

Music switches to viral Aavesham/Illuminati beat. Reddy and sidekick do the signature hand-flick dance step. Reddy rides the e-cycle in a circle inside the store. | **Crew:** "Reddy ra!"

**Reddy:** "Ooooh... Amma!"

**Text on screen:** *Reddy Rides Only BCH.*

**HOOK SCORE: 8.5/10**

| Dimension | Score | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Involuntary Attention Capture | 9/10 | Gold chains + slow-mo + low angle + car entry. Brain registers "mass hero entry" before conscious processing. |
| Cognitive Disruption | 9/10 | A gangster/don character in a CYCLE STORE. Status mismatch = "Why is a Reddy at BCH?" Brain cannot categorize this as an ad in 500ms. |
| Curiosity Gap | 8/10 | "What is this don going to do at a cycle shop?" Sustained through the rival confrontation. |
| Emotional Micro-Trigger | 9/10 | Instant recognition of the Reddy/rowdy trope. Humor + cultural pride fires for every Kannada/Telugu viewer. |
| Platform-Native | 8/10 | Uses trending Aavesham BGM. Kanglish dialogue. Vertical format. Looks like organic comedy, not a brand ad. |
| Sound-Off Effectiveness | 7/10 | Visual entry works on mute (gold, slow-mo, low angle). But rhyming punchlines need audio. Text overlays compensate partially. |
| Relevance Bridge | 10/10 | PERFECTLY tuned for Bangalore. Reddy trope, Kanglish, Yelahanka reference, Karnataka cinema. Every local viewer sees themselves. |
| Motion/Kinetics | 8/10 | Slow-mo entry, chain flick, seat slap, dance outro. Continuous physical motion. |
| Contrast/Color | 8/10 | Gold chains vs cycle store. Rusted cheap cycle vs premium e-cycle. White shirt Reddy vs dirty rival. Three-layer contrast. |
| Repetition Resilience | 8/10 | Rhyming punchlines reward rewatch ("Discount/Nervous", "Loose/Brain"). Character details add layers. |
| Thumbnail-Hook | 9/10 | Gold-chain man in a cycle store = instantly clickable. |
| Shareability | 9/10 | Character comedy + cultural reference + rhyming insults + dance outro = multiple share triggers. Will be tagged to friends. |

**What makes this work:**
- It's the **Cultural Property Hook** (8.3 formula) — mapping the Reddy/rowdy trope to BCH
- Combined with **Status Mismatch** (9.0 formula) — a don in a cycle store
- The **rhyming insults** create catchphrases that spread ("Discount/Nervous", "Loose/Brain")
- **BCH stats woven into character dialogue** — 1 lakh customers, 25 years, Yelahanka — delivered as Reddy's "flex" not as an ad read
- The rival's cheap online cycle getting DESTROYED (chain falling off) is the physical visual argument

**What to watch:**
- Sound-Off is 7/10 — the rhymes need audio. Fix: add text overlays for EVERY punchline so it works on mute
- Needs commitment to character. Half-effort Reddy = cringe. Full commitment = gold
- Keep under 60 seconds for Reels. The script above is tight at ~58 sec
- The Aavesham dance outro is time-sensitive — use while the trend is alive

**Shootable NOW:** YES — 2 young males + Syed Bhai. One as Reddy, one as sidekick, one as rival. Shoot at BCH store. Props: fake gold chains, sunglasses, one rusted old cycle, one e-cycle on display, a red plastic chair.

**Concept:** Rival brought his "online discount" cycle to show off. Reddy kicked it once and it died. Reddy picks up one rolling wheel, inspects it, TOSSES it over his shoulder. "This is not a cycle. This is a crime scene." Walks the rival to the exchange counter. "BCH gives Rs. 5,000-15,000 for your old cycle. Even THIS one. Even this has more value dead than alive."

"Rs. 1,200." Types it. SPINS the calculator to face the rival. "Rs. 8,200 per month on WASTE." Clears it. Types: 999. Pushes it to the rival's face. "E-cycle EMI. Rs. 999. Less than your BIRYANI habit." Rival stares. Reddy leans back: "Expensive-ah? Your LIFESTYLE is expensive. The cycle is CHEAP."

**Concept:** Reddy gets off, annoyed. "Hey! This cycle is broken! It won't go fast!" The salesman calmly: "Sir, it's speed-locked at 25 kmph. For safety." Reddy pauses. Processes. His annoyed face slowly turns to respect. "You mean... even if my nephew goes full Reddy mode... it won't cross 25?" "No, sir." Reddy turns to camera: "My nephew is CRAZY. This cycle is SMARTER than my nephew." He pats the cycle. "Safety lock. Even Reddy approves." Text: *Speed lock at 25 kmph. Because your kid rides like a Reddy too.*

A guy walks OUT without buying. Reddy STANDS UP: "Hey! Where are you going?" Guy: "Just looking." Reddy: "1 lakh people said 'just looking.' 80,000 of them BOUGHT. You think you are different?" The guy pauses. Turns around. Goes back in. CLICK. Reddy sits down. "80% conversion. Even Reddy's success rate is not this high." End text: *1,00,000 customers. 80% conversion. 25 years.*

Reddy starts counting on his fingers. Runs out of fingers. Starts counting on the sidekick's fingers. Bell, toolkit, bottle holder, mudguard, reflector, stand, phone mount, gloves, bag, chain guard, service card. By 15, the counter is BURIED. Reddy stares at the pile. Stares at the camera.

**Concept:** Reddy walks through the store touching every cycle like a king inspecting his army. "How many?" Salesman: "300+, sir." Reddy stops. "300? My gang has 30 members. This store has 300 SOLDIERS." He sits on one, poses, gets up, sits on another. The sidekick takes photos of him on EVERY cycle like a tourist at the Taj Mahal. By the fifth one, Reddy can't choose. "In 25 years, nobody has left this store empty. Because CHOICE itself is the trap." He gestures at the entire floor. "Even Reddy is confused. And Reddy is NEVER confused." Text: *300+ e-cycles. 25 years. Come choose your weapon.*

**Concept:** The dad resists. "I'm just looking—" Reddy: "LOOKING? You think Reddy LOOKS at food? No. Reddy EATS. Sit on the cycle." The dad reluctantly sits. Does a test ride across the store. His face CHANGES. The arms uncross. A tiny smile. Reddy watching from his chair, nodding knowingly. "See? The cycle sold you. Not me. Not the salesman. The CYCLE." Dad is already pulling out his card. Reddy to camera: "BCH has Rs. 99 home test ride also. But why go home? Come here. Let the cycle do the talking." Text: *Free test ride in-store. Rs. 99 home test ride.*

### R8. REDDY VS THE GRANDPA *(Handling Objections)*

**HOOK (0-3 sec):** An old man SLAPS Reddy's hand away from an e-cycle. "In MY time, we WALKED." Reddy freezes. Nobody slaps Reddy. The sidekick gasps.

**Concept:** Tension. Reddy stares at the old man. The old man stares back. Beat. Then Reddy slowly SITS DOWN. For the first time, he's not the alpha. "Uncle. Respect." The old man starts his speech: "5km to school. Uphill. Both—" Reddy: "Uncle. In your time, roads had no traffic. No pollution. No 50-degree summers. Your school was in the village. My nephew's school is through Silk Board." The old man opens his mouth. Closes it. Reddy: "The world changed. Transport should change with it." Long pause. The old man touches the e-cycle. "Speed kitna hai?" Reddy SMILES. "25 kmph. Speed locked. Even for YOU it's safe, uncle." The old man smiles back. Belief shifted. Text: *25 years of BCH. For every generation.*

**Concept:** Reddy looks at the broken cycle. "When did you buy this?" "3 months ago." "Where?" "Online." "Warranty?" "..." "Service center?" "..." "Mechanic?" "..." Reddy holds up a BCH warranty card like a royal decree. "2-year warranty. 8 full-time mechanics. Service at BCH, not on the FOOTPATH." He rides past the rival. Calls back over his shoulder: "Push fast. It's going to rain." Rival looks up at clear sky. Confused. Reddy: "I'm joking. But your cycle is not." Text: *2-year warranty. 8 mechanics. BCH service > your luck.*

Reddy FREEZES. "YOU... deliver... with CAKE?" "Yes sir. Gift wrapping, birthday cake, the full surprise." Reddy looks at sidekick. Looks at the cake on his head. Slowly takes it down. "You mean I carried this for NOTHING?" He shoves the cake at the sidekick. "You eat it." Turns to camera: "BCH handles the birthday. You just handle the emotions. Comment 'BIRTHDAY' for details."

He picks up the beaten cycle, places it gently on the ground like a patient. "This cycle needs a DOCTOR. Not a BUTCHER." Points toward BCH: "8 trained mechanics. Proper tools. Proper service. Not a footpath and a dream." He turns to the cycle: "Don't worry. Reddy will save you." Carries the cycle toward BCH dramatically. Text: *BCH: 8 mechanics. Real tools. Real service.

That's like calling the ocean a PUDDLE." Person 2: "I think they sell e-cycles." Reddy: "THINK? 1 lakh people don't THINK. They KNOW." Person 3: "Never been inside." Reddy STANDS UP, grabs the chair, walks them IN. "Today you learn." The person's face when they see 300+ cycles is the payoff. Reddy sits in his chair INSIDE the store now: "Told you. Not a puddle.

**Concept:** Reddy tries to answer. "Obviously. It's... uh..." The kid: "40-60km per charge. Lithium-ion. 4-hour charge time. Speed lock at 25. Weight 18kg. Pedal assist with 3 modes." Reddy's jaw drops. He looks at sidekick: "This kid knows more than my CA." The kid isn't done: "Also, 15 free accessories, 2-year warranty, and EMI starts at 999." Reddy takes off his sunglasses for the first time. Puts them ON the kid. "From today, YOU are Reddy junior." The kid grins. Rides off on the display e-cycle.

The chaiwala's eyes go wide. Reddy: "An e-cycle costs Rs. 33 per DAY on EMI. LESS than your daily chai." He pushes the chai back. "You're spending more on BROWN WATER than on your kid's FREEDOM." Turns to camera: "Rs. 33 per day. Less than chai. Less than chips. Less than the auto to your office." He drops the paper cup in the bin. "Cancel the chai. Buy the cycle."

Reddy takes a selfie with them. "How do you feel?" Customer (genuine reaction): "Shocked..." Reddy: "That's how your KID will feel when he sees this cycle."

**Concept:** Reddy to camera: "3 months ago, my gold chain was HIDING. My belly was a LANDLORD. The chain was a TENANT." He pats his now-flatter stomach. "Gym? Tried. 4 days. The treadmill and I are not friends." He gets on the e-cycle. "Pedal assist. Level 1: the cycle helps you. Level 2: you help the cycle. Level 3: you and the cycle are BROTHERS." He rides.

**Concept:** A new rider approaches nervously. Reddy: "Welcome. What is the first rule of Reddy Riders?" Kid: "...Ride every day?" Reddy: "CORRECT." "Second rule?" "If your friend doesn't ride, you ride WITH them until they do." Reddy nods. "Third rule?" Kid hesitates. Reddy: "NO. EXCUSES. ON. SUNDAYS." He hands the kid a wristband.

**Concept:** For the first time, Reddy is NOT the most powerful person in the room. "Syed Bhai..." He takes off his sunglasses. Folds them. Puts them in his pocket. "25 years. 1 lakh customers. 60% Bangalore market." He's listing stats like he's reading a legend's resume. He SITS DOWN — not on his throne, on a regular chair. Like a student. "Sir, I sell attitude. You sell TRUST. Attitude expires. Trust doesn't." Syed Bhai offers him chai. Reddy takes it with BOTH HANDS. The sidekick is in shock — he's never seen Reddy humble.

The BCH delivery guy arrives with an e-cycle. Reddy inspects it like he's checking a shipment. Sits on it. Rides it around his compound. Nods. "Approved." Sidekick: "Baas, the shop came to YOU." Reddy: "This is how it should be. Reddy doesn't go to the cycle. The cycle COMES to Reddy." Turns to camera: "Rs. 99. They bring the cycle. You try it at HOME. No showroom pressure.

- **DECOY:** The man looks lost. Touches the most expensive e-cycle on display. Staff exchanges a look. One approaches: "Sir, budget cycles are on that side. This one is... carbon fiber."
- **BAIT:** Man nods quietly. "Expensive-ah?" Staff: "Very expensive, sir. Maybe try the Rs. 25,000 range?" Man looks at the floor. Seems embarrassed.
- **REVEAL:** Man reaches INTO the vegetable bag. Past the onions. Past the coriander. Pulls out a THICK brick of Rs. 500 notes held by a rubber band. Drops it on the counter next to the tomatoes. "Pack two. One for me. One for my DRIVER." Staff's jaw DROPS.
- **EXIT:** Man picks up his vegetable bag, tucks it under his arm. Walks toward the exit. Turns back: "And put a bell on it. I like the *tring tring*." Walks out. Staff still frozen. End text: *Never judge a customer. Or a vegetable bag. BCH Yelahanka — premium e-cycles for EVERYONE.*

### S2. THE AUTO DRIVER'S REVENGE *(EMI Rs. 999 / Affordability)*

**HOOK (0-3 sec):** An auto rickshaw SCREECHES to a halt outside BCH. The auto driver — stained uniform, oil-streaked face — RIPS the meter off the dashboard, SLAMS it on the auto's roof. "LAST DAY. Done." He walks toward BCH.

**THE FLIP:**
- **DECOY:** The auto driver walks into BCH. A well-dressed customer inside is test-riding. Sees the auto driver and smirks to his wife: "Even auto drivers are window-shopping now."
- **BAIT:** Auto driver stands next to the premium section. The well-dressed guy leans in: "Bhaiya, the EMI section is that side. Rs. 999 per month. Even YOU can afford that." Patronizing smile.
- **REVEAL:** Auto driver pulls out his phone. Shows his bank balance — 6 figures. "I didn't come for EMI. I came for CASH payment." Turns to the salesman: "Full payment. No EMI. No loan. I saved for 2 years while HE was paying EMIs on his PHONE." Points at the well-dressed guy without looking.
- **EXIT:** Auto driver rides out of BCH on a new e-cycle. Passes his parked auto. Pats it on the hood like saying goodbye to an old friend. Doesn't look back. The well-dressed couple is now quietly asking about EMI options. End text: *BCH: Cash or EMI — Rs. 999/month. Your money, your choice.*

**BCH Message:** EMI Rs. 999 + full cash payment — accessible to everyone

### S3. THE CEMENT BOOTS *(BCH Store Experience / 300+ Range)*

**HOOK (0-3 sec):** CEMENT-COVERED construction boots STEP onto BCH's clean white floor. Grey footprints on every step. Camera tilts UP — a construction worker in a dusty hard hat, cement splattered across his face, rebar dust on his shoulders. He points at the MOST EXPENSIVE cycle on the wall mount.

**THE FLIP:**
- **DECOY:** Everyone in the store stares. A mother pulls her kid away. A staff member approaches nervously: "Sir... maybe wash hands first?" The worker looks at his cement-caked hands. Doesn't wash them.
- **BAIT:** Another customer whispers: "Is he lost? The construction site is next door." Giggles. The worker hears it. Keeps staring at the cycle. Silent.
- **REVEAL:** The worker pulls out a BUSINESS CARD from his shirt pocket. It reads: "Managing Director — [Construction Company]." He hands it to the staff member. "I'm not lost. I'm the one BUILDING the apartments next door. 200 flats. I'm buying 5 cycles for my site managers. BULK ORDER." He drops the card on the counter. "Bill my company."
- **EXIT:** Five e-cycles being wheeled out by staff to his site. The worker walks out in his cement boots, leaving grey footprints all the way to the door. Doesn't clean them. Doesn't care. End text: *BCH: 300+ e-cycles. From 1 to 50 — we handle every order. Walk in as you are.*

**BCH Message:** 300+ range, bulk orders welcome, no judgment

### S4. THE ROADSIDE MECHANIC *(2-Year Warranty / 8 Mechanics)*

**HOOK (0-3 sec):** A man with OIL-BLACK hands walks into BCH and PICKS UP a premium e-cycle by the frame with one hand. Lifts it clean off the ground. His forearm veins pop. Staff RUSHES over, arms waving: "Sir! SIR! Please put it DOWN!"

**THE FLIP:**
- **DECOY:** The man puts it down gently. He's in a grease-stained vest, torn shorts, a rag hanging from his pocket. Roadside cycle mechanic. Staff assumes he wandered in by mistake.
- **BAIT:** Staff (polite but dismissive): "The repair section is outside, sir. We have mechanics here — 8 trained ones." Subtle flex. The mechanic nods. Walks to the e-cycle's motor. Looks closely.
- **REVEAL:** The mechanic starts NAMING parts. "Brushless DC motor. 250 watt. Lithium-ion 36V battery. Hall sensor in the hub. Your torque arm is seated clean — good installation." Staff's face changes. He knows MORE than the staff. He flips the cycle upside down in one swift move. Checks the brakes. "Hydraulic disc. Good. Last shop I visited had V-brakes on an e-cycle. CRIMINAL." He stands up, wipes hands on rag. "I fix 40 cycles a DAY. I know what breaks and what doesn't. THIS one..." He pats the cycle. "This one won't break. I'll take it."
- **EXIT:** Staff hands him a warranty card. He LAUGHS. "2-year warranty? Brother, I AM the warranty." Rides out. End text: *Even mechanics choose BCH. 2-year warranty. 8 trained mechanics. Built to last.*

**BCH Message:** 2-year warranty, 8 mechanics, build quality

### S5. THE SCHOOL UNIFORM KID *(Kids Know More Than Adults)*

**HOOK (0-3 sec):** A kid in a TORN school uniform — ink stains, one broken strap, shoes held together with glue — SLAPS a handwritten list on the BCH counter. The paper is crumpled, edges torn. It reads: "BEST E-CYCLE UNDER 40K — COMPARISON." Staff leans forward. The list has 15 models with specs compared in NEAT columns.

**THE FLIP:**
- **DECOY:** A rich dad next to him with his kid is buying a cycle. His kid is on an iPad, bored. The rich dad points at a random cycle: "This one is good." Zero research. The school uniform kid overhears and SHAKES HIS HEAD.
- **BAIT:** Rich dad notices: "What? You know better, kid?" His tone is condescending. "Where's your father?"
- **REVEAL:** The kid UNFOLDS his crumpled paper on the counter. "Sir, that cycle has a lead-acid battery. It'll die in 8 months. The one next to it — lithium-ion, 40km range, 15 free accessories, 2-year warranty, Rs. 999 EMI. I've been researching for 6 MONTHS." He points at each spec. The rich dad's own kid looks up from the iPad for the first time. Even the staff is taking NOTES. The kid turns to the salesman: "This one. Final. Tell my father the EMI details. He's parking the auto outside."
- **EXIT:** The kid walks out, crumpled paper in his back pocket. The rich dad stares at his iPad-kid. Whispers: "Put the iPad down." End text: *BCH: even kids do the research. Rs. 999 EMI. 15 accessories. 2-year warranty. Do YOUR homework.*

### S6. THE DELIVERY BOY'S PAYDAY *(Daily Cost Rs. 33 / Savings)*

**HOOK (0-3 sec):** A Swiggy delivery bag SLAMS onto the BCH counter. A food container spills out, sauce dripping onto the glass. A delivery boy — drenched in rain, helmet still on, face exhausted — stands behind it. "I'm not here to DELIVER. I'm here to BUY."

**THE FLIP:**
- **DECOY:** Staff and customers stare. He looks like he can barely afford the food he delivers. Rain drips off his jacket onto the floor.
- **BAIT:** A customer in the store nudges his friend: "Bro, his monthly salary is probably less than this cycle." They laugh quietly. The delivery boy HEARS them.
- **REVEAL:** The delivery boy pulls off his helmet. Opens his phone. Shows his earnings dashboard — Rs. 45,000 last month. "I deliver 30 orders a day. Rain. Sun. Traffic. You know what I spend on petrol? Rs. 5,000 a month. You know what an e-cycle costs? Rs. 33 a DAY." He pulls out EXACT cash from his pocket — counted, rubber-banded, ready. "I calculated this 6 months ago. Today is payday." He places the cash on the counter. "The cycle will PAY FOR ITSELF in petrol savings. In 4 months, I'm in profit. Are YOU in profit?" He looks at the laughing customer.
- **EXIT:** The delivery boy rides out on his new e-cycle. Still in his Swiggy jacket. Still drenched. But grinning. The two customers are now looking at the EMI chart on the wall. End text: *Rs. 33/day. The cycle that pays for itself. BCH — smart money moves.*

**BCH Message:** Rs. 33/day cost, petrol savings, ROI framing
**Hook Formula:** Physical Action (8.4) — bag slam + food spill + rain-drenched entry

### S7. THE WATCHMAN'S LATHI *(Home Test Ride Rs. 99)*

**HOOK (0-3 sec):** A security guard's bamboo lathi DROPS onto the BCH counter like a gavel. THUD. Everyone in the store FREEZES. The guard is in full uniform — khaki, belt, cap. He unbuckles his shirt pocket. Pulls out a carefully folded Rs. 100 note.

**THE FLIP:**
- **DECOY:** Staff approaches cautiously. "Sir... can I help you?" The guard unfolds the Rs. 100 note slowly. Places it flat on the counter. Staff thinks he's asking for change.
- **BAIT:** A customer nearby snickers: "Bro, does he think Rs. 100 will buy a cycle?" His friend: "Maybe a bell."
- **REVEAL:** The guard speaks for the first time. Calm. Clear. "Rs. 99 home test ride. Book it." Staff's eyes light up — this man knows the EXACT offer. "My duty ends at 10 PM. I live in Electronic City. Bring the cycle to my house at 10:30. I'll test it while my family watches. If THEY approve, I'll buy it on the spot. EMI." He picks up his lathi. Taps it once on the counter. "Understood?"
- **EXIT:** 10:30 PM. BCH delivery arrives at the guard's house. His kids SCREAM with excitement. His wife smiles. The guard — now in a simple lungi, no uniform — test rides the e-cycle in his colony. Neighbors watch. He rides back, nods once. "Pack it." His kid jumps on his back. End text: *Rs. 99 home test ride. We come to YOU. Book now — link in bio.*

**BCH Message:** Rs. 99 home test ride, doorstep delivery

### S8. THE SLIPPER SWAP *(Exchange Program Rs. 5K-15K)*

**HOOK (0-3 sec):** A man walks into BCH dragging a DESTROYED, rusted cycle behind him. The chain is dragging on the floor, making a HORRIBLE scraping metal sound. Sparks fly. Every head turns. He DROPS the cycle in the middle of the store. CLANG.

**THE FLIP:**
- **DECOY:** The cycle is genuinely the worst thing anyone has ever seen. Bent frame, missing seat, one wheel has no rubber. Staff gathers around like a crime scene. A customer takes a PHOTO of it.
- **BAIT:** Customer laughs: "Bro, you came to the WRONG place. The kabadiwala is down the road." Others laugh. The man stands silently next to his dead cycle.
- **REVEAL:** The man finally speaks. Points at the wreck. "How much?" Staff: "Sir?" "EXCHANGE. How much do I get for THIS?" Staff checks the system. "Sir... Rs. 5,000 minimum exchange value." The man's eyes go wide. The CUSTOMER's eyes go wider. "Rs. 5,000 for THIS? This thing is DEAD." Staff: "Anything on two wheels, sir. Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 15,000 exchange value." The man reaches into his pocket. Pulls out Rs. 15,000 more in cash. "Rs. 5,000 exchange + Rs. 15,000 cash + EMI on the rest. I calculated it last night. I'm taking THAT one." Points at a premium e-cycle. The laughing customer's smile DISAPPEARS.
- **EXIT:** The man rides out on a brand new e-cycle. His old rusted wreck sits in the store like a monument. Staff puts a sign on it: "EXCHANGED — Rs. 5,000." The kabadiwala joke customer is now asking: "Wait... I have an old cycle too..." End text: *Bring ANY old cycle. Get Rs. 5,000-15,000 exchange. Even if it's dead. BCH exchange program.*

**BCH Message:** Exchange program — Rs. 5,000-15,000 for any old cycle

### S9. THE IDLI UNCLE *(25-Year Legacy / Trust)*

**HOOK (0-3 sec):** An old man in a white veshti and sacred ash on forehead walks into BCH carrying a steel tiffin box. He OPENS it on the counter. Steam rises. Inside: perfectly stacked idlis. "First, EAT. Then we talk business."

**THE FLIP:**
- **DECOY:** Staff is confused. Customers are confused. This looks like someone's grandfather who wandered in from a temple. He starts DISTRIBUTING idlis to everyone in the store. People take them out of sheer bewilderment.
- **BAIT:** A young tech bro in AirPods walks up: "Uncle, this is a cycle store, not a restaurant." Chuckles at his own joke. The old man doesn't react. Offers him an idli. Tech bro declines.
- **REVEAL:** Syed Bhai walks out from the back. Sees the old man. His face LIGHTS UP. "Ramanna sir!" They EMBRACE. Syed Bhai turns to everyone: "This man was my FIRST customer. 25 years ago. He bought a cycle from me when I had only 3 cycles in stock. He's been coming here every year since." Ramanna nods. "25 years. I bought 11 cycles from this man. For my children. My grandchildren. Now..." He picks up the smallest e-cycle. "For my GREAT-grandchild." He pulls out a handwritten list — 11 purchases over 25 years. Dates, models, prices. All documented.
- **EXIT:** Syed Bhai refuses payment. "First customer. Free." Ramanna refuses the refusal. They argue. The tech bro with AirPods is filming them on his phone, tears forming. End text: *25 years. 1 lakh families. The trust is REAL. BCH — where customers become family.*

**BCH Message:** 25-year legacy, multi-generational trust, founder authenticity
**Hook Formula:** Contradiction (8.8) — idli tiffin in a cycle store + Physical Action

### S10. THE SLEEPING GIANT *(Pedal Assist / Fitness)*

**HOOK (0-3 sec):** A FAT man is ASLEEP on the BCH store bench. Full-on snoring. Belly rising and falling. Mouth open. One chappal hanging off his foot. A kid POKES his belly. It JIGGLES. The man doesn't wake up. The kid pokes again. More jiggle.

**THE FLIP:**
- **DECOY:** Staff tries to wake him. "Sir... sir, the store is open." He snorts, doesn't wake. A fit customer walks in, sees him, shakes his head: "This guy needs a gym, not a cycle store."
- **BAIT:** The fit customer starts test-riding an e-cycle, showing off. Turns to the sleeping man: "Bro, wake up. Even the CYCLE can't carry you." He laughs.
- **REVEAL:** The sleeping man's PHONE ALARM goes off. He wakes up. Yawns. Stretches. Pulls out his phone — shows a 6-MONTH transformation photo. THE SLEEPING MAN IS THE "BEFORE" — and the photo shows him 20kg lighter, same face, different body. "I used to be bigger than this. 6 months of pedal assist. Level 1, then level 2, then level 3. I lost 20kg riding to work and back." He stands up. Lifts his shirt slightly — loose belt, had to punch 3 new holes. "I was waiting for my cycle to get serviced. The SERVICE is free for 6 months." He takes his serviced cycle from the back. Rides away. The fit customer's smirk is gone.
- **EXIT:** The fit customer quietly walks to the pedal assist section. Starts reading the specs. End text: *Pedal assist e-cycle. Lose weight without punishment. 6 months of free service. BCH — the silent gym.*

**BCH Message:** Pedal assist fitness, free service period, transformation

### PATTERN ANALYSIS — WHAT SCORED HIGHEST

**Top hook formulas across all 131 concepts:**
1. **Contradiction (8.8)** — Character doing the OPPOSITE of what you'd expect. Used in: R19, S9, R13, R8, S5
2. **Physical Destruction (8.4)** — Breaking/burning/smashing in first frame. Used in: O2, R1, S8, O3
3. **Status Mismatch (9.0)** — Low-status person in high-status context (or reverse). Used in: S1, S3, S4, S7, R6
4. **Physical Barrier/Disruption (8.4)** — Grabbing, slamming, throwing, blocking. Used in: C8, I10, R7, R15, C1
5. **Real Reactions** — Genuine surprise from non-actors. Used in: R15, R12, S4

**What separates Tier 1 from Tier 4:**
- Tier 1: Body does something DRAMATIC in frame 1. Works on mute. Single-frame thumbnail tells a story.
- Tier 4: Good story, but the first 3 seconds look like any other video. Needs watching to appreciate.

**Biggest risk across the board: Sound-Off Effectiveness.**
- 70% of Reels are watched on mute.
- Every Tier 1 concept works on mute (physical action carries it).
- Most Tier 4 concepts rely on dialogue or emotional performance to land.
- FIX: Add text overlays for EVERY punchline. Visual first. Always.

# 🔥 100 NEW CONCEPTS — THE ABSURD METAPHOR COLLECTION

**The rule:** Take an everyday kid/parent/screen situation. Reframe it through an absurdly dramatic genre. The genre mismatch IS the concept. One sentence = you laugh. No BCH stats. No hook scores. Pure entertainment. Product appears naturally at the end (or doesn't).

---

---

## N7 — THE RANSOM NOTE

## N50 — THE CONSPIRACY BOARD

Mother in front of a wall covered with strings, photos, and clippings. Red strings connect everything. "YouTube leads to BGMI, which leads to Netflix, which leads to NO SUNLIGHT, which leads to ZERO OUTDOOR ACTIVITY." Steps back. "It's all connected." Father: "So what's the solution?" Mother points to a photo of an e-cycle in the center. "This. This breaks the cycle." Pause. "Pun intended."

## N54 — THE ADOPTION PAPERS

Mother slides papers across the table. "What's this?" Kid reads: "ADOPTION CERTIFICATE. We are officially adopting... an e-cycle. As your sibling." Kid: "You're replacing me?" Mother: "Not replacing. Upgrading. The cycle goes outside. You should try being more like your new brother."

---

## N55 — THE CENSUS FORM

Father going door to door in his OWN house with a clipboard. Knocks on kid's bedroom door. "Census survey. How many hours outdoors today?" Kid: "Zero." Father writes. "How many hours on screen?"

## N66 — THE ALARM SYSTEM

Mother installs an actual alarm on the front door — but in REVERSE. It goes off when the kid DOESN'T leave by 4 PM. Alarm blaring. Red lights. "ALERT: CHILD HAS NOT EXITED THE HOUSE. DAY 47." Kid runs out just to stop the noise. E-cycle is waiting. "Fine! I'm going!" Alarm stops. Mother sips chai peacefully.

Episode 2 coming soon.

## N88 — THE BLACKOUT EPISODE

Mother "accidentally" trips the house's main switch. Everything dies — WiFi, TV, chargers, lights. Kid emerges from his room like a cave creature. Blinking. Confused. "What... what year is it?"

## N90 — THE SOS SIGNAL

Kid on the couch. His hand slowly rises and taps out SOS on the armrest. "S... O... S..." Mother decodes it. "He's calling for help." Father: "He's been on that couch for 11 hours. It's critical."

Kid: "Appa, you're not dying." Father: "No, but your childhood is. Go ride."

---

## N98 — THE FOOD CHAIN DIAGRAM

But she said one thing." Flashback. Mother: "One day you'll be too old for this. Too busy. Too far away. Ride it now." Pause. "I rode it that day. And every day after." Cut to kid riding e-cycle through the colony at golden hour. "That cycle didn't just take me outside. It gave me back 4 years I was about to lose." BCH logo. No pitch. Just the feeling.

---

*That's 100 concepts. Every single one follows the same DNA: take a real kid/parent/screen moment, reframe it through an absurd dramatic genre, let the genre mismatch do the work. The concept IS the hook. One sentence = you laugh. Zero BCH stats. Pure entertainment.*

---

# 🏍️ 50 POCKET BIKE CONCEPTS — ZUBAIR & SAMI SERIES

**Product:** Super Dirt Bike — 50CC Pocket Petrol Bike (Orion)
**Specs:** 50CC 2-stroke, pull start + electric start, all disc brakes, inverted forks, adjustable shocks, alloy exhaust, 1.5L tank, 23kg weight, 45km/h top speed, 90kg load capacity, 62cm seat height. Available in yellow, red, green, orange. Looks like a mini Rocky Bhai bike.
**Cast:** Zubair (main), Sami (supporting)
**The comedy:** It's TINY but looks AGGRESSIVE. Adults ride it and look ridiculous. It sounds like a monster but fits under a bed. 23kg means you can literally CARRY it. The genre mismatch between "serious dirt bike energy" and "it's the size of a suitcase" does all the work.

---

## PB1 — THE KGF ENTRY

Zubair does the full Rocky Bhai slow-motion entry — leather jacket, sunglasses, dramatic KGF BGM, dust in the air. Camera reveals from the bottom up: boots, legs, hands on the handlebar... and it's a pocket bike. His knees are near his chest. Sami standing there with a regular bike, jaw on the floor. Zubair, dead serious: "It's not about the size, Sami. It's about the entry."

---

## PB2 — THE PETROL BUNK

Zubair pulls into a petrol bunk. Full confidence. "Full tank." Attendant starts filling. Meter barely moves. Stops at Rs. 150. Attendant: "Bro... this is FULL?" Zubair: "1.5 litres. That's the whole tank." Attendant looks at the nozzle, looks at the bike, looks at Zubair. Calls his colleague: "Come see this." Sami filming from behind, dying.

---

## PB3 — THE VALET

Zubair pulls up to a fancy hotel on the pocket bike. Hands the key to the valet like he's dropping off a Benz. "Careful with her." Valet stares down at this tiny thing. "Sir, I can just—" picks up the ENTIRE BIKE with one hand and moves it to the side. Zubair, offended: "Bro. You can't just CARRY someone's vehicle." Sami at the entrance, face in hands.

---

## PB5 — THE PULL START

Zubair in the parking lot. Grabs the pull-start cord. Pulls. Nothing. Pulls harder. Nothing. Sami: "Is this a bike or a lawnmower?" Zubair pulls one more time with EVERYTHING he's got — the 2-stroke SCREAMS to life. Raw, angry, loud. Every single person in the parking lot turns around expecting a superbike. It's this tiny thing vibrating with fury. Zubair: "50cc of pure anger, Sami."

---

## PB7 — THE PARKED NEXT TO A BULLET

Zubair parks the pocket bike next to a Royal Enfield Bullet. Side by side. The pocket bike reaches the Bullet's WHEEL hub. Sami places objects for scale: a water bottle (same height as the seat), a school bag (bigger than the bike), a dog that walks past (same height). Zubair sitting on it, knees at his chest: "Same disc brakes though."

---

## PB8 — THE SOUND REVEAL

Pitch black screen. Just audio. A VIOLENT 2-stroke engine revving. Sounds like a dirt bike racing event. Getting louder. Angrier. You're picturing a 450cc motocross machine. Lights slowly come up. It's the pocket bike. Shaking with rage. Barely 2 feet tall. Zubair on it looking like he's riding a toy. Sami: "23 kilos and makes more noise than your entire personality."

---

## PB10 — THE RACE

Zubair on the pocket bike. Sami on a regular bicycle. Traffic signal. Both lock eyes. Light goes green. Zubair LAUNCHES — the 2-stroke screaming. Sami pedaling with everything he has. 10 seconds later, Zubair is 3 blocks ahead. Sami arrives 2 minutes later, drenched in sweat. Zubair hasn't broken a sweat. "45km/h, Sami. Petrol beats pedal."

---

## PB11 — THE CARRY

Dead Bangalore traffic. Nobody moving. Zubair gets off the pocket bike. Picks up the ENTIRE BIKE with one hand (23kg). Puts it on his shoulder. Walks past every car, every auto, every bus. Reaches the other side of the jam. Puts the bike down. Gets on. Rides away. Every driver watched the whole thing. Sami, stuck in the traffic: "BRO COME BACK FOR ME!"

---

## PB12 — THE MINI MOTOGP

Close-up: racing boots hit concrete. Gloves snap on. A helmet visor SLAMS shut. All shot dark, cinematic, slow-mo — pure MotoGP grid energy. Engine revs (sounds like an angry lawnmower). Wide shot REVEALS: it's a 7-year-old kid. Full racing suit, oversized helmet wobbling on his head, knee guards bigger than his knees. He swings one leg over the pocket bike — barely taller than him. Hits the dirt. Leans into corners with dead seriousness. Tiny rooster tail of dust. Sami commentating like his life depends on it: "AND THE YOUNGEST RIDER IN INDIA TAKES THE CORNER AT FULL LEAN! 50CC OF PURE AGGRESSION! THE CROWD GOES WILD!" Camera pans to "the crowd" — 3 stray dogs and a chai guy who hasn't looked up once.

---

## PB13 — THE FIRST DATE

Zubair shows up to pick someone up. Fully groomed. Cologne. New shirt. "Get on." They look down. Way down. "On... THAT?" Zubair: "50cc petrol engine. Disc brakes. Inverted forks. Top speed 45. You'll never feel more alive." They both squeeze on. Knees up. Helmets touching. Riding at 30km/h through Bangalore. Sami following on foot, somehow keeping up: "I'm the third wheel. Literally."

---

## PB14 — THE SHOWROOM FLEX

Zubair walks into a premium bike showroom. Hayabusa on display. He looks around, completely unimpressed. Salesman: "Sir, interested in something?" Zubair shows the pocket bike photo on his phone. "Already have something better." Salesman leans in. Zooms in. "Where did you get this?" Zubair: "BCH. And no, it doesn't need a loan." Sami outside holding the pocket bike, posing.

---

## PB15 — THE BODYGUARD

The pocket bike is being escorted. Zubair on one side, Sami on the other. Both in black sunglasses. Walking slowly. Hands clasped. The bike rolls between them on a red carpet (it's a red bedsheet). People staring. They stop. Zubair takes a cloth, wipes the seat. Sami adjusts the mirror. They continue. The bike is the celebrity. They are security.

---

## PB16 — THE IMPOSSIBLE PARKING

Giant mall parking lot. FULL. Every spot taken. Zubair spots a 2-foot gap between two SUVs that isn't even a parking space. Slides the pocket bike right in. Perfect fit. Gets off. Takes out a chain lock that's bigger than the bike. Wraps it three times. Sami: "Bro, someone could just pick up the bike AND the chain." Zubair: "That's why you're standing guard." Walks into the mall.

---

## PB17 — THE BANK LOAN

Zubair at a bank. "Vehicle loan, please." Banker: "Make and model?" Zubair: "50cc Super Dirt Bike." Banker types. Frowns. "Not in our system, sir." Zubair: "It has disc brakes on both wheels, inverted forks, adjustable shock absorbers—" Banker: "Sir, you're describing a KTM Duke." Zubair: "Better. It weighs 23 kilos and I can carry it in an elevator." Banker: "...Can I see this bike?" Sami outside: "ANOTHER ONE CONVERTED."

---

## PB18 — THE ACCESSORIES

Zubair in the garage. "Today we accessorize the beast." Adds a phone mount — it's bigger than the headlight. Adds a horn — louder than the engine. Adds LED strips — the bike now glows like a spaceship. Adds a tank pad on the 1.5L tank. Steps back. Sami: "Bro. The accessories cost more than the bike." Zubair: "You don't put a price on DRIP."

---

## PB19 — THE GROUP RIDE

Sunday morning. A line of Royal Enfields, one Harley, two KTMs — and Zubair on the pocket bike. Group leader does a headcount. Double-takes at Zubair. "Bro... THAT'S your ride?" Zubair: "That's my ride." They all roll out. Zubair is a DOT between the big bikes. But at the first traffic signal, Zubair filters through ALL of them to the front. Sami on the back of someone's Enfield: "HE'S LEADING THE PACK AND HIS BIKE FITS IN THEIR SADDLEBAG!"

---

## PB21 — THE NIGHT RIDE

2 AM. Empty Bangalore road. Street lights. The 2-stroke echoing through empty streets. Camera low — at this angle, the pocket bike looks MASSIVE. Headlight cutting through the dark. Zubair riding slow. Cinematic. Everything looks like a movie. Until a speed breaker hits and both Zubair and the bike bounce a foot in the air. He lands, keeps riding. "ADJUSTABLE SHOCKS, SAMI. WORTH IT."

---

## PB22 — THE DELIVERY BOY

Zubair with a Swiggy bag on the pocket bike. Arrives at the door. Customer opens. Looks down. Way down. "You delivered... on THAT?" Zubair: "Fastest delivery in Bangalore. Zero traffic problems. I fit through every gap. 45km/h." Customer: "But the food is cold." Zubair: "But I was FAST." Sami waiting on the road: "Bro, just give him the food and let's GO."

---

## PB23 — THE INSURANCE CALL

Zubair on the phone: "I'd like to insure my vehicle." Agent: "Make and model?" Zubair: "50cc Super Dirt Bike." Agent: "CC?" Zubair: "50." Long silence. "Sir, our minimum is 100cc." Zubair: "But it has disc brakes on BOTH wheels. Inverted forks. Alloy exhaust. It goes 45—" Agent: "Sir, does it fit in a suitcase?" Zubair: "...almost." Click. Sami: "Told you they wouldn't understand."

---

## PB24 — THE 7-DAY TANK

Zubair fills the 1.5L tank. Rs. 150. Monday, he rides. Tuesday, rides. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday. Sunday — pulls into the same bunk. Same attendant. "Back already?" Zubair: "It's been 7 DAYS." Attendant: "On... 1.5 litres?" Calls his colleagues: "BRO, COME SEE THIS." Four attendants crowded around the pocket bike. Sami narrating: "Rs. 150 per week. My auto to work costs more PER DAY."

---

## PB25 — THE ELEVATOR RIDE

Zubair wheels the pocket bike into his apartment elevator. It fits. With space for 3 more people. Residents get in, stare at the bike, stare at Zubair. He presses 5. Awkward silence. Doors open. Zubair RIDES the bike down the corridor. Into his apartment. Sami holding the door open: "Just park it outside like a normal—" Zubair: "She sleeps INSIDE."

---

## PB26 — THE BIKE WASH

Zubair at a professional bike wash. The workers wash Bullets and Pulsars all day. They see the pocket bike. Dead stare. "Bro... full service?" Zubair: "Full service. Foam wash." They foam it up. One guy picks up the entire bike with one hand while the other sprays underneath. Total wash time: 90 seconds. The fastest wash they've ever done. Zubair pays full price. Sami: "You paid Rs. 200 to wash something smaller than a suitcase."

---

## PB27 — THE ROAD TRIP

Zubair packing like he's crossing the country. Bag. Map. Snacks. Sunglasses. Sami: "Where are you going?" Zubair: "Road trip. Bangalore to Whitefield." Sami: "That's 20 km." Zubair: "On THIS bike, that's an EXPEDITION." Montage: Zubair weaving through traffic, hitting a pothole, jumping a speed breaker, stopping for chai. Arrives at Whitefield. Plants a tiny flag on the handle. "WE MADE IT. 1.5 litres. Zero stops."

---

## PB28 — THE FULL GEAR

Zubair puts on a full-face racing helmet. Visor down. Racing gloves. Knee guards. Armored jacket. Riding boots. He looks like he's about to race at Buddh Circuit. Gets on the pocket bike. His GEAR weighs more than the bike. Sami: "Bro, your helmet alone is 2 kilos. The bike is 23." Zubair: "Safety first, Sami. Safety first." Rides off at 30km/h looking like Valentino Rossi on a toy.

---

## PB29 — THE LOCK

Zubair parks the pocket bike outside a shop. Takes out a MASSIVE industrial chain. Wraps it around the bike. The chain is thicker than the bike frame. Adds a padlock the size of his fist. Steps back. The lock setup weighs more than the bike. Sami: "Anyone can just pick up the bike WITH the chain and leave." Pause. Zubair: "... SAMI, YOU STAND HERE AND GUARD IT."

---

## PB30 — THE BIG GUY TEST RIDE

A big, tall guy at BCH. "I want to try." Gets on the pocket bike. He's 6 feet. His knees are ABOVE the handlebars. Elbows out. He looks like a circus bear on a tricycle. Starts riding. 10 metres. Comes back. Gets off. Everyone expects him to laugh. Instead: "I'll take one." Dead serious. Nobody argues with that face. Sami to camera: "Every. Single. Person. Same reaction."

---

## PB31 — THE SPEEDOMETER

Phone mounted on the handlebars. Speed app running. Zubair goes full throttle on an empty road. The number climbs: 20... 30... 40... 45km/h. At 62cm seat height, 45 feels like 150. The ground is RIGHT THERE. Wind is LOUD. Zubair's eyes are wide. Comes back. Hands shaking. Sami: "You look like you just survived something." Zubair: "I DID. 45km/h has never felt so FAST."

---

## PB32 — THE SPEC COMPARISON

Zubair with a whiteboard. Two columns. LEFT: "Rs. 2 Lakh Bike." RIGHT: "Pocket Bike." Disc brakes? Both. Inverted forks? Both. Can you carry it in an elevator? Only pocket bike. Can you park it in 2 feet? Only pocket bike. Does it fit in a car boot? Only pocket bike. Rs. 150 fills the whole tank? Only pocket bike. Zubair taps the board: "And one of these costs 10 TIMES more." Sami: "He's got a point."

---

## PB33 — THE BUS STOP REVEAL

Zubair sitting at a bus stop. Bus comes. He waves it off. Another bus. Waves it off. Sami: "What are you doing? Get on!" Zubair: "I'm not waiting for a bus." Reaches behind the bench — pulls out the pocket bike. It was HIDDEN behind the seat (it's that small). Pull-starts it. Rides off. Everyone at the bus stop just watched a man reveal a MOTORCYCLE from behind a bench.

---

## PB34 — THE CAR BOOT

Zubair opens the boot of a sedan. It's a normal car. Puts the pocket bike INSIDE the boot. Closes it. Drives the car to a destination. Opens boot. Takes out the bike. Rides the last 2 km. Sami standing there: "You just carried a BACKUP VEHICLE in your car." Zubair: "First mile — car. Last mile — pocket bike. Problem solved."

---

## PB35 — THE BEFORE/AFTER

BEFORE: Zubair in an auto. Stuck in traffic. Meter running. Sweating. Late. AFTER: Zubair on the pocket bike. Weaving through gaps. On time. Rs. 5 of fuel. BEFORE: Walking to the store. 30 minutes. AFTER: Pocket bike. 4 minutes. BEFORE: Borrowing Sami's bike. AFTER: Own pocket bike, fits in the house, costs less than a month of auto rides. Sami: "I want my bike back." Zubair: "Don't need it anymore."

---

## PB36 — THE UNBOXING

Darkened room. Spotlight. Zubair in a black turtleneck. A cardboard box sits center frame. 1100 x 270 x 560mm. He opens it slowly. Pulls out each component like it's a jewel — the frame, the forks, the wheels, the engine. Assembles on camera with dramatic music. Final piece clicks. He hits the start button. Engine ROARS. Sami throws confetti. "IT'S ALIVE. 50CC OF FURY. FROM A BOX."

---

## PB37 — THE ONE-HAND LIFT

Bike meetup. Everyone comparing. KTM guy revving. Bullet guy polishing. Pulsar guy talking specs. Zubair rolls in on the pocket bike. Silence. Then he just... picks up his ENTIRE BIKE with one hand. Holds it overhead. Looks at KTM guy: "Can you do that?" Looks at Bullet guy: "You?" Looks at Pulsar guy: "Anyone?" Nobody moves. Zubair puts the bike down. Gets on. Rides away. Argument won.

---

## PB38 — THE GYM

Sami mocking Zubair at the gym: "You can't even bench 50." Zubair: "I don't need to. I bench my BIKE." Goes to the parking lot. Picks up the pocket bike. Does 5 bicep curls. 23kg per arm. Puts it down. "My bike is my dumbbell. And after the workout, it takes me HOME." Does a few squats holding the bike. Sami: "That's actually... kind of impressive." Zubair: "It's DEFINITELY impressive."

---

## PB39 — THE BEDROOM PARKING

Zubair's mother: "Where's your bike?" Zubair: "Safe." Mother: "WHERE?" Zubair opens his bedroom door. The pocket bike is parked NEXT TO HIS BED. Like a sleeping pet. Mother: "YOU CANNOT KEEP A PETROL BIKE IN YOUR ROOM." Zubair: "It's only 23 kilos, Ammi. And it fits perfectly between the bed and the wall." Sami on video call, wheezing. Zubair strokes the handlebar: "Good night, baby."

---

## PB40 — THE WEIGH-IN

Zubair with a bathroom scale. Places the pocket bike on it: 23kg. Places Sami's college backpack: 18kg. Places a full water can: 20kg. The bike weighs BARELY more than daily household objects. Zubair: "My bike weighs less than a big suitcase. But it goes 45km/h. Name one suitcase that does that." Sami: "Name one bike that fits in a suitcase." Both pause. Both look at the pocket bike. It might actually fit.

---

## PB41 — THE SOUND PRANK

Zubair records the pocket bike's exhaust note — raw, angry 2-stroke scream. Takes the recording to a bike café. Plays it on a Bluetooth speaker. Everyone turns: "WHAT is that? That's nasty!" "Is that a two-stroke racing bike?" People searching for the source. Zubair stops the audio. Holds up his phone: "It's a 50cc pocket bike." Nobody believes it. He goes to the parking lot. Starts the bike. SAME SOUND. Jaws hit the floor.

---

## PB42 — THE RTO VISIT

Zubair at the RTO. Long queue. Gets to the counter. "I want to register this vehicle." Shows the photos. The officer adjusts his glasses. Turns the photo sideways. Turns it upside down. "Sir... this is a vehicle?" Zubair: "50cc petrol, 2-stroke, disc brakes, 45km/h." Officer: "Sir. Under 50cc doesn't need registration." Zubair: "I KNOW. I just wanted to show someone." Officer, despite himself: "...it IS nice." Sami outside: "ANOTHER FAN."

---

## PB43 — THE AUTO RACE

Traffic signal. Zubair on the pocket bike. A Bangalore auto next to him. Both stare straight ahead. Light turns green. Zubair LAUNCHES — tiny wheels spinning, 2-stroke screaming, he's GONE. Auto driver floors it. No chance. 3 signals later, Zubair is waiting. The auto pulls up. Sami hangs out the auto window: "I'm PAYING Rs. 80 for this ride and you spent Rs. 5 of petrol to DESTROY us."

---

## PB44 — THE OVERLOADED

Zubair straps a massive bag on the pocket bike. A box on top. A bag on the side. The cargo is 3x the size of the bike. He starts riding. From behind, all you see is luggage moving at 30km/h. The bike is invisible. Sami walking alongside, filming: "Bro, it looks like a pile of boxes gained consciousness and learned to drive."

---

## PB45 — THE COLONY ALARM

5:30 AM. Silent colony. Zubair pull-starts the pocket bike. The 2-stroke SHATTERS the silence. EVERY window lights up. Dogs bark. Babies cry. One uncle on a balcony in a lungi: "WHAT TIME IS IT?!" Zubair, already on the move: "MORNING RIDE, UNCLE!" Sami running behind: "GO BEFORE THEY FORM A MOB!" The colony's new alarm clock.

---

## PB46 — THE TWO-UP

Both Zubair and Sami on the pocket bike. 90kg load capacity — they BARELY make it. Two grown men on a bike smaller than a chair. Knees overlapping. Helmets touching. Riding at 20km/h through the colony. A kid on a regular bicycle rides past and looks DOWN at them. The role reversal is complete. But Zubair and Sami are laughing so hard they can barely steer.

---

## PB47 — THE DOG CHASE

A street dog spots Zubair on the pocket bike. The dog is TALLER than the bike. Chase begins. Zubair: "SAMI! SAMI IT'S CHASING ME!" Full throttle — 45km/h. The dog is MATCHING him. Sharp turn — the disc brakes save his life. Dog slides past. Zubair stops, panting. Looks at the bike with new respect: "The disc brakes just earned their keep." Sami filming from a tree: "THE DOG IS BIGGER THAN YOUR BIKE."

---

## PB48 — THE RAIN

Heavy Bangalore rain. Traffic stopped. Autos pulled over. Cars crawling. One tiny figure cutting through it all at ground level — Zubair on the pocket bike, rain hammering his helmet, tiny knobby tires gripping the wet road. Arrives at the destination. Soaked. But ON TIME. Sami, arriving 40 minutes later by auto: "How?" Zubair: "18cm ground clearance. Knobby tires. And no driver who says 'meter double in rain.'"

---

## PB49 — THE MUSEUM

Zubair builds a display in his room. Tiny platform. Spotlight from a desk lamp. Red rope barrier (it's a shoelace). When Sami and friends visit, they get a "guided tour." Zubair, wearing a blazer: "Notice the alloy exhaust. Observe the upside-down fork absorbers. The disc brakes — front AND rear." Friend reaches out to touch. Zubair slaps the hand: "LOOK. DON'T TOUCH." Sami: "It's a bike, not the Kohinoor." Zubair: "To me, it is."

---

## PB50 — THE CHAIN REACTION

Zubair riding the pocket bike through the colony. A kid on the street freezes. Eyes HUGE. Runs to his dad: "I WANT THAT." Dad looks at the pocket bike. Looks at the kid. Looks at the pocket bike again. Zubair stops. Lets the kid sit on it — it's the PERFECT size for a kid. The kid's face LIGHTS UP. Dad takes a photo. Asks: "Where'd you get this?" Zubair: "BCH. Bharath Cycle Hub." Dad saves the number. Sami filming: "That's 3 customers today. Just from RIDING." Zubair: "You don't sell a pocket bike. You just let people SEE it."

---

*50 concepts. Zubair and Sami. One pocket bike. The comedy is built into the product — a tiny bike with big bike energy. Every concept exploits the size mismatch, the sound mismatch, or the attitude mismatch. The bike sells itself; the content just shows it in the wild.*

# 🕶️ RAY-BAN META POV SERIES — HIDDEN CAMERA REAL REACTIONS (RM1–RM20)

**Format:** Zubair wears Ray-Ban Meta glasses — built-in camera captures first-person POV. Real people, real locations, zero clue they're being filmed. Sami films backup angle from a distance. The genuine reactions ARE the content. You can't script that face.

**Dual angle shoot on every script:**
- **Angle 1 (MAIN):** Ray-Ban Meta POV — what Zubair sees. Raw, candid, real.
- **Angle 2 (BACKUP):** Sami filming from a distance — wide shot reveals the full absurdity of the pocket bike in context.

**Product:** Super Dirt Bike — 50CC Pocket Petrol Bike (Orion)
**Cast:** Zubair (main, wearing Ray-Ban Meta), Sami (backup camera + reactions)

---

## RM1 — THE DRIVE-THROUGH

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair's hands on tiny handlebars, 2-stroke revving, pulling into a McDonald's/KFC drive-through lane. He's behind a Fortuner. The Fortuner moves. Zubair pulls up to the speaker box. Problem: the speaker is 4 feet up, designed for car windows. Zubair's head is BELOW the speaker. He's talking UP at it like he's praying.

**SCENE 1 — THE ORDER**

**RAY-BAN POV:** Zubair cranes his neck up at the speaker box. It's above his head.

**ZUBAIR:** "One McChicken meal, please."

**SPEAKER** (confused, can hear him but the sensor didn't trigger properly): "Sir... are you in a vehicle?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Yes. 50cc petrol engine."

Silence.

**SPEAKER:** "Sir, please pull up to the window."

**SCENE 2 — THE WINDOW**

**RAY-BAN POV:** Zubair pulls up to the pickup window. The window is chest-height for a car. For Zubair on the pocket bike, it's above his HEAD. He's reaching UP to grab the bag like a kid reaching for a cookie jar on the top shelf.

Window opens. Employee leans out. Looks LEFT (expecting a car). Looks RIGHT. Then looks DOWN. Way down. Sees Zubair on the pocket bike. The face — captured PERFECTLY by the Ray-Ban because they're looking directly at him.

**EMPLOYEE** (hand over mouth): "Bro... WHAT is that?"

**ZUBAIR** (reaching up): "Just give me my McChicken, bro."

Employee turns around. Calls two colleagues. Three heads poking out of the drive-through window, all looking DOWN at the pocket bike. One of them pulls out their OWN phone to take a photo — Ray-Ban captures them filming him.

**SCENE 3 — THE EXIT**

**CUT TO SAMI'S WIDE SHOT:** The full picture — a tiny pocket bike at a drive-through window designed for SUVs. Three employees hanging out the window. Zubair holding a McDonald's bag that's almost bigger than his fuel tank.

Zubair rides off. 2-stroke screaming through the drive-through lane.

**SAMI** (to camera): "The bag is bigger than the bike's tank. He ordered MORE food than the bike holds fuel."

---

## RM2 — THE TOLL BOOTH

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair riding on a highway approach road. Toll booth ahead. The boom barrier is at car roof height — about 5 feet up. Zubair on the pocket bike is barely 3 feet tall on the seat. He rides STRAIGHT UNDER the closed barrier without stopping. Doesn't even duck. Clears it by 2 feet.

**SCENE 1 — THE CONFUSION**

Toll booth operator sees this on his screen. Something went under the barrier. Comes out of the booth. Looks around. Zubair has stopped on the other side, waiting.

**RAY-BAN POV:** Operator walks toward Zubair. Looks at the pocket bike. Looks at the barrier. Looks at Zubair.

**OPERATOR:** "Bhai... tu barrier ke neeche se nikal gaya?"

**ZUBAIR:** "It didn't touch me."

**OPERATOR:** "But... toll? You have to pay toll."

**ZUBAIR:** "For this? This is 50cc. Smaller than a bicycle."

**OPERATOR** (squatting down to inspect the bike, face right at Ray-Ban level): "Yeh kya hai? Bike hai ya khilona?"

**SCENE 2 — THE CROWD**

Two more toll operators come out. One lorry driver gets out of his cab to look. A whole mini-crowd around this tiny bike at the toll booth.

**RAY-BAN POV:** All their faces are looking DOWN at the bike. Every reaction captured.

**OPERATOR 2:** "Kitna deta hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "45 km/h."

**OPERATOR 2:** "Aur tank?"

**ZUBAIR:** "1.5 litres. 150 rupees full."

**OPERATOR 1** (to his colleague): "150 mein full tank, aur humse 75 toll maang raha hai."

Everyone laughs. Zubair rides off. Doesn't pay toll. Nobody stops him — they're too busy laughing.

**SAMI'S WIDE SHOT:** The pocket bike next to the toll booth. The barrier arm is comically high above. Every other vehicle is a truck or car. The scale difference is absurd.

---

## RM3 — THE PUNCTURE SHOP

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair pushing the pocket bike toward a roadside puncture repair guy. The bike's tire is TINY — maybe 10 inches. The puncture guy's toolbox is bigger than the wheel. His hands are bigger than the tire.

**SCENE 1 — THE INSPECTION**

**ZUBAIR:** "Bhai, puncture hai."

Puncture guy puts down the Activa tire he was fixing. Looks at the pocket bike wheel. Picks up the ENTIRE WHEEL with one hand (he doesn't even need a stand). Turns it around.

**RAY-BAN POV captures his face:** Half laughing, half confused.

**PUNCTURE GUY:** "Yeh tyre hai ya biscuit?"

He pulls out his puncture repair kit. The patch is BIGGER than the hole area on the tiny tube. He has to cut the patch down to size. His regular tools are too big — the tyre lever barely fits.

**SCENE 2 — THE FIX**

**PUNCTURE GUY** (to the other guys sitting around): "Aye, aao dekho. Life mein aisa tyre nahi dekha."

Three guys gather. All looking at this tiny tire. One guy holds it next to his face — same diameter. Ray-Ban captures all of them examining this miniature wheel like it's an archaeological find.

Puncture guy fixes it in 90 seconds. The fastest repair of his career.

**PUNCTURE GUY:** "Kitna du? Normally 50 lete hain but... yeh toh half tyre hai. 25?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Deal."

Rides off. Puncture guy watches him leave. Shakes his head. Goes back to the Activa tire — it looks MASSIVE now by comparison.

**SAMI** (walking past the puncture shop): "Bhai, kya tha woh?"

**PUNCTURE GUY** (unprompted, to Sami): "Pata nahi bhai. Bike tha, cycle tha, kuch toh tha."

---

## RM4 — THE APARTMENT GATE

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair riding toward a gated apartment complex. Boom barrier down. Security guard in the booth sees headlights approaching. Presses the intercom. Standard protocol. Then the "vehicle" rolls into the light — it's the pocket bike. The guard's hand freezes over the barrier button.

**SCENE 1 — THE REGISTER**

**GUARD** (leaning out of booth window, looking DOWN): "Sir... vehicle number?"

**ZUBAIR:** "No number. 50cc. Registration not required."

**GUARD** (opens his thick register, pen ready): "Make and model?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Orion Super Dirt Bike."

Guard writes it down. Looks at what he wrote. Looks at the bike. Crosses it out.

**GUARD:** "Sir, yeh two-wheeler hai ya... kya hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Petrol bike. 2-stroke engine."

**GUARD** (comes out of the booth, walks around the bike — Ray-Ban POV tracks his full circle, which takes 3 seconds because the bike is that small): "Sir, I can't give you two-wheeler parking. This is... this doesn't fit in any category."

**SCENE 2 — THE SOLUTION**

**ZUBAIR:** "Where do I park then?"

**GUARD** (genuine confusion, thinking hard): "Bicycle stand?"

**ZUBAIR:** "It's a PETROL BIKE."

**GUARD:** "Then two-wheeler parking?"

**ZUBAIR:** "It won't reach the kickstand pad. The Activas will CRUSH it."

Guard calls his supervisor on walkie-talkie. Ray-Ban captures the conversation.

**GUARD** (into walkie): "Sir, ek vehicle aaya hai... two-wheeler bhi nahi hai, bicycle bhi nahi hai... haan... nahi sir, petrol hai... nahi sir, chhota hai... bahut chhota... haan sir aap aa jao."

**SAMI'S WIDE SHOT:** The pocket bike at the boom barrier. The barrier arm is so high it's not even in the same frame as the bike. Two guards and a supervisor standing around this tiny machine, scratching their heads.

---

## RM5 — THE HIGHWAY DHABA

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair pulls into a highway dhaba. All parked vehicles: 16-wheeler lorries, Traveller vans, one Tata 407. The pocket bike parks between two truck tires. The bike is the SAME HEIGHT as the truck's wheel. It vanishes between them.

**SCENE 1 — THE PARKING**

Zubair parks, gets off, walks into the dhaba. Dhaba owner and truck drivers sitting on charpoys, eating.

**ZUBAIR:** "Ek plate meals, bhai."

**DHABA GUY:** "Haan baitho. Truck kaunsa hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Truck nahi. Bike."

**DHABA GUY:** "Kahan hai? Outside nahi dikhi."

**ZUBAIR:** "It's between the two trucks."

Dhaba guy walks outside with Zubair. RAY-BAN POV: They're both looking at the parking area. Dhaba guy can't find it. Because it's hidden between two truck tires.

**DHABA GUY** (finally spots it): "Yeh... YEH hai teri ride?"

**SCENE 2 — THE TABLE**

Zubair sits down to eat. Word spreads. Three lorry drivers come over. RAY-BAN POV captures them TOWERING over Zubair, chai in hand, staring at the bike through the dhaba entrance.

**LORRY DRIVER 1:** "Bhai, mere truck ka silencer isse bada hai."

**LORRY DRIVER 2:** "Kitna deti hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "1.5 litre tank. 150 rupees full."

All three drivers go silent. They spend Rs. 15,000 on diesel per trip.

**LORRY DRIVER 1** (dead serious): "Bhai, next janam mein yeh chalaunga."

**SAMI:** Shows up 10 minutes later on an auto. Walks in. Sees Zubair eating with three truckers. "Bro, you've made FRIENDS?"

---

## RM6 — THE HELMET SHOP

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair walks into a helmet shop carrying a full-face helmet. He places it on the counter. The shop guy looks at the helmet, then at Zubair.

**SHOP GUY:** "Exchange?"

**ZUBAIR:** "No. New one. For my bike."

**SHOP GUY:** "Kaunsi bike?"

Zubair holds up his phone — photo of the pocket bike.

**SHOP GUY** (zooms in on the phone, face coming close to Ray-Ban camera): "Bhai... yeh bike hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "50cc petrol."

**SHOP GUY:** "Yeh toh helmet se chhoti hai."

He picks up the full-face helmet and holds it NEXT to the bike photo for scale. Then he holds the helmet in front of Zubair's body, at seat height — the helmet is WIDER than the bike's handlebars.

**SHOP GUY** (to his assistant): "Bhai, pehli baar hua hai ki helmet bike se bada hai."

**SCENE 2 — THE FIT TEST**

Shop guy starts showing helmets. Every helmet looks oversized for the concept of riding that bike. He pulls out a kids' helmet as a joke.

**SHOP GUY:** "Yeh try kar — bike ke size ke hisaab se."

**ZUBAIR** (straight face): "Full face. DOT certified. I ride at 45km/h."

**SHOP GUY** (pauses): "45?! Uss chhote pe?!"

**ZUBAIR:** "Disc brakes both sides. Inverted forks."

**SHOP GUY** (now genuinely curious, no longer laughing): "Kitna hai yeh?"

**ZUBAIR:** "BCH, Bharath Cycle Hub. Come see it."

Shop guy saves the number. Another customer converted through a helmet shop.

**SAMI** (outside, to camera): "Went to buy a helmet. Sold a bike."

---

## RM7 — THE NUMBER PLATE GUY

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair at a roadside number plate maker's stall. He slides a piece of paper across with the dimensions he wants. The number plate guy reads it, looks up, reads it again. The required plate size is SMALLER than his hand.

**NUMBER PLATE GUY:** "Bhai, yeh kaunsi gaadi ka hai? Scooty?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Bike. 50cc."

**NUMBER PLATE GUY:** "Itni chhoti plate? Yeh toh nahi banega standard mein. Custom katna padega."

He measures out the plate on a sheet. It's the size of a credit card holder.

**NUMBER PLATE GUY:** "Dikhao bike."

Zubair walks him to the pocket bike parked outside. RAY-BAN POV captures the guy's walk, the moment he sees it, full reaction.

**NUMBER PLATE GUY** (stops walking): "..."

Long pause.

**NUMBER PLATE GUY:** "Bhai, isko plate ki zaroorat nahi hai. Isko NAAM ki zaroorat hai."

He touches the alloy exhaust. Checks the disc brakes. Squats down and looks at the engine.

**NUMBER PLATE GUY:** "Yeh toh proper bike hai but chhota hai. Kitne ki aati hai?"

Another conversion. From a number plate guy.

**SAMI** (filming from across the road): "He went for a plate. Left with a fan."

---

## RM8 — THE PAID PARKING

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair rides into a commercial paid parking lot. Attendant tears a ticket. Hands it over without looking up. Then looks up. Down. At the bike. The ticket is the same width as the handlebar.

**ATTENDANT:** "Bhai... yeh kya hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Two-wheeler. Parking kitna?"

**ATTENDANT:** "Two-wheeler 20 rupees but..." He looks at the bike. Looks at his rate card. Looks back.

**ATTENDANT:** "Yeh two-wheeler nahi hai. Yeh... half-wheeler hai."

**ZUBAIR:** "50cc petrol engine. Disc brakes. It's a two-wheeler."

**ATTENDANT:** "10 rupees le lunga. Half rate for half bike."

**ZUBAIR:** "Deal."

**SCENE 2 — THE SPOT**

Attendant walks Zubair to the two-wheeler section. Activas, Jupiters, Pulsars — all parked tight. Attendant looks at a tiny gap between two scooters that isn't a real parking spot.

**ATTENDANT** (pointing at the gap): "Wahan daal de."

Pocket bike slides in PERFECTLY. Disappears between the two scooters. You can't even see it anymore.

**ATTENDANT** (laughing, to his colleague): "Yeh toh gayab ho gaya!"

RAY-BAN POV: Zubair looks back at his parked bike. It's genuinely invisible between the scooters. Just a handlebar poking out.

**SAMI** (walking in later, looking for the bike): "Bro WHERE did you park?"

**ZUBAIR:** "It's there. Somewhere."

---

## RM9 — THE SCHOOL ZONE

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair riding past a school at dispersal time. Stops at a signal. A school bus is next to him. Kids in the bus window spot the pocket bike. Every face presses against the glass. 8-10 kids STARING down at this tiny bike through the bus window. Their faces — pure wonder — captured in the Ray-Ban.

**SCENE 1 — THE MOB**

Signal turns green. Zubair rides ahead. Parks near the school gate. Bad idea. The bus unloads. Kids stream out. One kid spots the bike.

**KID 1:** "BRO LOOK AT THAT!"

Within 10 seconds, 15 kids surround the pocket bike. RAY-BAN POV is just a circle of tiny faces looking at Zubair, then DOWN at the bike, then back at Zubair.

**KID 2:** "Is this real?"

**KID 3:** "Can it go fast?"

**KID 4:** "My cycle is bigger than this!"

**KID 1:** "START IT START IT START IT!"

**SCENE 2 — THE START**

Zubair pull-starts the bike. The 2-stroke SCREAMS. Half the kids jump back. The other half step CLOSER. A teacher comes running.

**TEACHER** (pushing through kids): "What's happening— what IS that?"

**RAY-BAN POV:** Teacher's face. Complete confusion.

**KID 1** (tugging teacher's arm): "Miss, I want this. Tell my dad."

**KID 5** (already on the phone): "Appa, come here NOW. There's a MINI BIKE."

One parent actually walks over. RAY-BAN captures the parent's face going from concern → confusion → "how much does this cost?"

**SAMI** (filming from across the road, can barely see Zubair through the crowd of kids): "He went to pick up a friend's kid. Now he's running a SHOWROOM on the footpath."

---

## RM10 — THE CHAI TAPRI

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair pulls up to a roadside chai stall. Kills the engine. The 2-stroke goes silent. The chai guy freezes mid-pour. He heard the engine but the "bike" that produced it makes no sense. He's holding a chai glass in one hand, kettle in the other, staring at the pocket bike like it's an alien.

**SCENE 1 — THE ORDER**

**ZUBAIR:** "Ek cutting, bhai."

Chai guy pours the chai. Hands it over. But his eyes are on the bike, not the glass. Almost misses Zubair's hand.

**CHAI GUY:** "Yeh... kya hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Bike."

**CHAI GUY:** "Bike? Itni chhoti?"

**ZUBAIR:** "50cc. Petrol."

Chai guy puts the kettle down. Wipes hands on his cloth. Walks around the counter. RAY-BAN POV follows him as he approaches the pocket bike. He circles it once. Twice.

**CHAI GUY** (yells to the next tapri): "RAJU! IDHAR AA!"

Raju comes. Then the paan wala from next door. Then the newspaper guy. Within 2 minutes, 5 roadside vendors are crowded around the pocket bike, chai going cold on the counter.

**SCENE 2 — THE QUESTIONS**

**PAAN WALA:** "Kitne ki hai?"

**NEWSPAPER GUY:** "License lagta hai?"

**CHAI GUY:** "Kitna deti hai?"

**RAJU:** "Mujhe bhi chahiye."

Everyone talking over each other. Zubair drinking chai, answering each question calmly.

**ZUBAIR:** "150 rupees full tank. No license needed. 45 speed. BCH se milti hai."

**CHAI GUY** (doing mental math out loud): "150 full tank... meri chai 15 rupees... matlab 10 chai mein full tank... ek hafte ka fuel ek din ki chai se sasta..."

He's selling the bike to HIMSELF. RAY-BAN captures the exact moment a chai vendor does the math and realizes the pocket bike costs less to run than his own chai habit.

**SAMI** (sitting on a bench behind the tapri, filming): "He stopped for chai. Now there's a PRODUCT DEMO happening. The chai is Rs. 15 and the sales pitch is free."

---

## RM11 — THE AIR PUMP

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair at a petrol bunk air pump station. He's holding the air hose nozzle near the pocket bike's tire. The nozzle head is almost the same DIAMETER as the tire. It looks like he's trying to inflate a balloon with a fire hose.

**SCENE 1 — THE ATTEMPT**

Zubair tries to fit the air nozzle onto the valve. Standard nozzle, tiny valve. It barely grips.

Air pump attendant walks over. Sees the situation. Looks at the tire. Looks at the nozzle in his hand. Looks at Zubair.

**ATTENDANT:** "Bhai... yeh cycle ka tyre hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Bike ka hai. 50cc."

**ATTENDANT** (squats down — his face now at PERFECT Ray-Ban level): "Bhai, do pump mein full ho jayega. Zyada daala toh phat jayega."

He carefully presses the nozzle. PSSSST. One second. Done. Both tires done in 5 seconds total.

**ATTENDANT:** "Yeh toh mere bacche ki cycle ke tyre se bhi chhota hai."

**SCENE 2 — THE GATHER**

The attendant next to him (the petrol filling guy) wanders over. Then a customer waiting for air for his Innova. All of them now staring at the pocket bike.

**INNOVA GUY:** "Yeh road pe chalta hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "45 km/h."

**INNOVA GUY** (looking at his Innova, then at the pocket bike): "Meri gaadi ka ek tyre isse bhari hai."

**ATTENDANT:** "Aur iski air 5 second mein bhar gayi. Aapka Innova 5 minute lagta hai."

Everyone laughs. RAY-BAN captures the Innova owner's face — he's not offended, he's genuinely amused.

**SAMI** (pretending to check his phone near the water tap): "Air for all 4 tires: 5 seconds flat. World record."

---

## RM12 — THE NIGHT WATCHMAN

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — 11:30 PM. Dark street. Zubair riding toward a gated community. Engine SCREAMING in the silent night — 2-stroke echoing off buildings. The watchman at the gate grabs his torch and lathi. Shines the torch toward the sound. The beam hits... this tiny pocket bike with a grown man on it. The torch beam DROPS as the watchman's hand goes limp with confusion.

**SCENE 1 — THE GATE**

**WATCHMAN** (torch in face — Zubair's face — but actually in Ray-Ban camera): "Kaun hai?!"

**ZUBAIR:** "Resident. Flat 304."

**WATCHMAN:** "Vehicle kya hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Bike."

**WATCHMAN** (shines torch on the bike, then back at Zubair, then on the bike again): "Yeh... yeh toh..."

He doesn't have words. He opens the gate. But he follows Zubair inside, walking alongside, torch still on the bike. He can't stop looking.

**WATCHMAN:** "Sir, raat ko itni awaaz karti hai yeh. Complaint aayegi."

**ZUBAIR:** "2-stroke hai bhai. Nature hi aisi hai."

**WATCHMAN:** "Sir, meri torch isse lambi hai."

**SCENE 2 — THE PARKING**

Watchman follows Zubair to the parking area. Watches him park it between two scooters. The bike disappears.

**WATCHMAN** (genuine concern): "Sir, chori ho jayegi. Dikhi hi nahi."

**ZUBAIR:** "23 kilos hai. I'll carry it upstairs."

Zubair picks up the entire bike. Watchman watches a man carry a motorcycle under his arm into the elevator. He turns to his colleague, who was watching the CCTV.

**WATCHMAN:** "Tu... tune dekha?"

**SAMI** (walking in 5 minutes later through the same gate, the watchman is still standing there): "Bhai, sab theek?"

**WATCHMAN** (to Sami, still processing): "Tera dost... bike uthake... upar le gaya..."

---

## RM13 — THE WEIGHBRIDGE

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair rides the pocket bike onto a TRUCK weighbridge. The massive metal platform designed for 40-tonne lorries. The pocket bike is a dot on the platform. The digital display reads: 0.00... 0.00... flickers... 0.02 tonnes. 23 kilos on a platform built for 40,000 kilos.

**SCENE 1 — THE READING**

Weighbridge operator is in his booth. He sees the display change from 0.00 to 0.02. Thinks the machine is glitching. Comes out.

**RAY-BAN POV:** Operator walks toward Zubair across the massive weighbridge platform. Takes him a while — the platform is 18 metres long. Zubair is in the centre, sitting on the pocket bike, waiting patiently.

**OPERATOR:** "Bhai, kya kar raha hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Weighing my vehicle."

**OPERATOR:** "Yeh TRUCKS ke liye hai!"

**ZUBAIR:** "But it works, right? 0.02 tonnes. That's 20 kilos. Plus me, 0.08 tonnes."

**OPERATOR** (looking at the display, doing the math involuntarily): "Tere samet bike ka weight... mere ek tyre se kam hai."

**SCENE 2 — THE RECEIPT**

**ZUBAIR:** "Receipt milega?"

**OPERATOR** (laughing now): "Kisko dikhayega? Insurance wale ko?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Proof chahiye. 23 kilo ki bike. People don't believe me."

The operator, despite everything, prints a receipt. Hands it over. RAY-BAN captures the receipt — the truck weighbridge slip showing 0.02 tonnes. Official stamp and all.

**OPERATOR** (as Zubair rides off the platform — which takes 10 seconds because the platform is that big): "Isse chhota kuch nahi aaya aaj tak iss weighbridge pe."

**SAMI** (parked outside on an Activa): "Bro needed a GOVERNMENT CERTIFICATE to prove his bike weighs nothing."

---

## RM14 — THE UBER BACKSEAT

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair standing on the curb. Uber arrives. A sedan. Zubair opens the rear door. Then he picks up the pocket bike with one hand and SLIDES IT INTO THE BACKSEAT. Like luggage. The Uber driver's head WHIPS around.

**SCENE 1 — THE LOAD**

**DRIVER** (turning around fully): "Bhai bhai bhai — kya daal raha hai??"

**ZUBAIR:** "Meri bike."

**DRIVER:** "BIKE?! Backseat mein?!"

**ZUBAIR:** "23 kilos. It fits."

RAY-BAN POV: The bike IS fitting. It sits on the backseat like a large suitcase. Handlebars poking between the front seats.

**DRIVER:** "Yeh petrol hai? Gaadi mein petrol nahi rakh sakte!"

**ZUBAIR:** "Tank khaali hai. Chill."

**DRIVER** (examining it through the rearview — Ray-Ban captures his mirror reflection): "Bhai, aaj tak rickshaw mein cycle daali hai logon ne. Sedan mein bike? Pehli baar."

**SCENE 2 — THE RIDE**

They drive. At every red signal, the car next to them looks into the window. RAY-BAN POV: People in adjacent cars see a MOTORCYCLE sitting in the backseat like a passenger. Double takes everywhere.

One auto driver pulls alongside. Looks in. His face — captured by Ray-Ban through the car window.

**AUTO DRIVER:** "Bhai... woh bike hai kya andar?"

**UBER DRIVER** (now laughing, has accepted the absurdity): "Haan bhai. Mera customer aur uski bike. Dono backseat mein."

They arrive at the destination. Zubair tips the driver. Opens the door. Lifts out the bike. Places it on the road. Gets on. Rides away.

Uber driver sits there. Car parked. Processing.

**SAMI** (was in the front seat the whole time, now outside): "Bhai ne Uber kiya apni bike ke liye. The bike was the passenger. He was the escort."

---

## RM15 — THE PHOTO STUDIO

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair rides the pocket bike THROUGH the door of a small roadside photo studio. It fits through the door. The studio guy behind the counter jumps up — a vehicle just entered his shop.

**SCENE 1 — THE REQUEST**

**ZUBAIR:** "Bhai, passport size photo chahiye. Mere aur meri bike ka."

**STUDIO GUY** (backing up as the bike rolls to a stop inside his 10x10 shop): "Bhai... bike ANDAR laya??"

**ZUBAIR:** "It fits."

It does fit. The pocket bike is inside the photo studio, between the printer and the blue backdrop.

**STUDIO GUY:** "Passport size mein bike bhi chahiye?"

**ZUBAIR:** "One solo. One with the bike."

Studio guy sets up. Blue backdrop. Ring light. Zubair sits ON the pocket bike INSIDE the studio. Studio guy steps back to frame the shot. The entire bike fits in the passport photo frame.

**STUDIO GUY** (looking through the camera viewfinder): "Bhai, normal passport photo mein sirf face aata hai. Teri bike bhi puri aa rahi hai. Bina zoom out kiye."

**SCENE 2 — THE SHOOT**

Studio guy takes the photo. Shows it on the screen. There's Zubair, on the pocket bike, inside a photo studio, with a blue passport background. It looks like the world's smallest vehicle registration photo.

**STUDIO GUY** (can't stop laughing now): "Bhai, frame karwa le. Yeh toh kisi ko batayega toh maanenge nahi."

**ZUBAIR:** "Print 4 copies. Mummy ko bhi chahiye."

**SAMI** (standing outside the studio door, couldn't fit because the bike took his space): "There's literally no room for me because a MOTORCYCLE is inside a PHOTO STUDIO."

---

## RM16 — THE STICKER WRAP GUY

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair at a bike graphics/sticker wrap shop. He places the pocket bike ON THE COUNTER. Not next to the counter. ON it. Like a laptop. The wrap guy stares at this vehicle sitting on his workbench.

**WRAP GUY:** "Bhai... yeh... table pe kaise?"

**ZUBAIR:** "23 kilos. Uthaake rakh diya. Full body wrap chahiye."

**SCENE 1 — THE MEASUREMENT**

Wrap guy takes out his measuring tape. Measures the body panels. Every measurement is in centimetres, not metres. The total surface area is smaller than a laptop skin.

**WRAP GUY:** "Bhai, normally ek bike ka wrap 2 din lagta hai. Yeh... 20 minute mein ho jayega."

He pulls out his smallest vinyl sheet. Starts cutting. He's using LEFTOVER pieces from other jobs — a piece from a Pulsar wrap, a piece from a KTM job. The pocket bike is getting wrapped in scrap vinyl that other bikes left behind.

**WRAP GUY:** "Yeh matte black chal raha hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Matte black. Racing stripes. Carbon fiber look on the tank."

**WRAP GUY** (holds up the "tank" — the 1.5L fuel tank): "Yeh tank hai? Meri water bottle isse badi hai."

He wraps the tank in 30 seconds. One strip of carbon fiber vinyl. Done. The entire bike is wrapped in 15 minutes.

**SCENE 2 — THE BILL**

**WRAP GUY:** "Full bike wrap normally 5000. But isme toh material hi 200 rupees ka laga. 500 le lunga."

**ZUBAIR:** "Done."

**WRAP GUY** (admiring his work — RAY-BAN captures him tilting his head, looking at the wrapped pocket bike on his counter): "Actually... achi lag rahi hai. Matte black mein proper lagti hai."

He takes a photo FOR HIS OWN INSTAGRAM. The pocket bike just became portfolio content for the wrap guy.

**SAMI** (outside): "Wrap cost less than the petrol to ride here."

---

## RM17 — THE FRUIT VENDOR

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair stops at a roadside fruit cart. Buys a watermelon. Holds it up next to the pocket bike. The watermelon is the same SIZE as the fuel tank. He places it on the seat. The bike looks like it's carrying a green boulder.

**SCENE 1 — THE BALANCE**

**FRUIT VENDOR:** "Auto mein daalun?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Nahi, bike pe le jaunga."

Vendor looks around for the bike. Can't see it. Zubair points DOWN. The pocket bike is hidden behind the fruit cart.

**FRUIT VENDOR** (peers over the cart, looks down): "USPE?!"

**ZUBAIR:** "90 kilo load capacity. Watermelon 5 kilo. Easy."

He places the watermelon between his legs on the seat. Starts the bike. The 2-stroke screams. The watermelon vibrates violently on the seat.

**FRUIT VENDOR** (yelling after him): "BHAI PHAT JAYEGA! VIBRATION SE JUICE BAN JAYEGA!"

Three other customers at the fruit cart watch Zubair ride off with a watermelon on a pocket bike. RAY-BAN captures their faces in the rearview — all filming on their phones.

**SAMI** (walking behind with a bag of bananas): "The watermelon weighs 20% of the bike. Imagine driving a car with a passenger that's 20% of the car's weight... actually that's normal. Bad example. But LOOK AT IT."

---

## RM18 — THE BIKE SERVICE CENTER

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair walks into a Hero/Bajaj authorized service center. Not pushing the bike in. CARRYING it under one arm. He places it on the service bay floor. The mechanic's jaw drops. Every other bike in the service bay is 150cc+. The pocket bike looks like someone's kid left a toy.

**SCENE 1 — THE SERVICE**

**SERVICE GUY:** "Bhai... yeh kya hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "50cc, 2-stroke. Service due. Oil change chahiye."

**SERVICE GUY:** "Oil change? Isme oil kitna lagta hai?"

**ZUBAIR:** "About 400ml."

**SERVICE GUY** (to his colleague): "400ml. Mere haath dhone mein zyada paani lagta hai."

He wheels out the oil drain tray. It's designed for bikes that hold 1-1.5 litres. The pocket bike's oil barely covers the bottom of the tray.

**SERVICE GUY** (watching the oil drip): "Bhai, yeh toh khatam bhi ho gaya."

**SCENE 2 — THE INSPECTION**

Service guy does a full inspection because he's curious. Checks disc brakes. Checks inverted forks. Checks the exhaust. With every component he touches, his respect grows.

**SERVICE GUY:** "Bhai, components toh proper hai. Disc brakes dono side. Inverted fork. Alloy exhaust. Yeh chhota hai lekin REAL bike hai."

**ZUBAIR:** "Wahi toh."

**SERVICE GUY** (turns to his boss): "Sir, ek AISE bike ki service karni hai. Dekhoge?"

Boss walks over. RAY-BAN captures the boss's face — first confusion, then curiosity, then the universal question:

**BOSS:** "Kitne ki aati hai?"

**SAMI** (sitting in the waiting area between two Pulsar owners, both staring at the pocket bike): "The waiting area is staring. Their bikes are in surgery. His bike got a 5-minute checkup."

---

## RM19 — THE PARKING TICKET GUY

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair comes back to where he parked the pocket bike. A parking enforcement guy is standing there, writing a ticket. On a pocket bike. The ticket pad is wider than the bike seat he's sticking the ticket to.

**ZUBAIR:** "Bhai bhai bhai, kya hua?"

**PARKING GUY:** "No-parking zone. Challan."

**ZUBAIR:** "But... it's so small. Did you even NOTICE it?"

**PARKING GUY** (honest): "Nahi, actually pehle nahi dikha. Phir jab dikha toh socha kisi ka khilona hai. Phir engine dikha."

**SCENE 1 — THE DEBATE**

**ZUBAIR:** "Bhai, this doesn't even take up parking space. A DOG is taking more space than my bike right now."

There IS a street dog sleeping 2 feet away that's genuinely taking up more ground area.

**PARKING GUY** (looks at the dog, looks at the bike — RAY-BAN captures the comparison hitting him): "..."

**PARKING GUY:** "Rules rules hote hain, bhai."

**ZUBAIR:** "Fine. Kitna challan?"

**PARKING GUY:** "Two-wheeler: 200."

**ZUBAIR:** "200 ka challan. 150 ka full tank. Challan bike se mehenga hai PER WEEK."

**PARKING GUY** (this hits him — pauses writing): "150 mein full tank??"

And just like that, the challan conversation becomes a product conversation. The parking enforcement guy stops writing, squats down, starts examining the bike.

**PARKING GUY:** "1.5 litre tank? Mere bacche ko pasand aayegi..."

**ZUBAIR:** "BCH. Bharath Cycle Hub."

Parking guy tears the ticket. "Aaj chhodta hoon. But next time PROPER parking."

**SAMI** (across the road): "Bro got a challan cancelled by accidentally selling the bike to the cop."

---

## RM20 — THE CAR MECHANIC

**HOOK (first 2 sec):** RAY-BAN POV — Zubair rides the pocket bike into a CAR workshop. Not a bike shop. A CAR garage. The car on the hydraulic lift is 3 metres above. The pocket bike rolls UNDER the lifted car with clearance to spare. Zubair rides under a suspended Innova like it's a tunnel.

**SCENE 1 — THE ENTRANCE**

Every mechanic in the garage stops. One guy is under a car on a creeper — he rolls out, sees the pocket bike at eye level (because he's lying down), and freezes.

**MECHANIC ON CREEPER:** "Bhai... yeh bike hai ya remote control car?"

**ZUBAIR:** "Petrol bike. 2-stroke. Service chahiye."

**HEAD MECHANIC** (walks over, wiping hands): "Bhai, yeh CAR garage hai."

**ZUBAIR:** "But you know engines, right? 50cc, 2-stroke."

**HEAD MECHANIC:** "Bhai, mere ek cylinder mein 1500cc hota hai. Tere poore bike mein 50."

He squats down. RAY-BAN captures his face going from dismissal → curiosity → respect as he starts examining.

**SCENE 2 — THE LIFT**

**HEAD MECHANIC:** "Ek kaam kar. Lift pe rakh."

Two guys LIFT the pocket bike onto the hydraulic car lift. Hit the switch. The lift goes UP. The pocket bike — designed for ground level — is now 6 feet in the air on a platform built for Innovas. It looks like a toy in a museum display case.

Every mechanic in the shop gathers. 6 guys. All looking UP at a pocket bike on a car lift. RAY-BAN captures Zubair looking up with them.

**MECHANIC 1:** "Bhai, lift ka electricity bill isse zyada hoga."

**MECHANIC 2:** "Yeh toh mere toolkit se halka hai."

**HEAD MECHANIC** (admiring it from below): "Chhota hai but build quality dekho. Disc brakes. Inverted fork. Alloy exhaust. Kisi ne soch ke banaya hai."

He lowers the lift. Places the bike down gently.

**HEAD MECHANIC:** "Service nahi karunga — isme kuch karne layak nahi hai. But photo lene de."

Takes a photo. For himself. The car mechanic is now a pocket bike fan.

**SAMI** (sitting on a tire stack in the corner, filming): "Car garage mein bike ki service. The lift costs more than the bike. The oil tray is bigger than the engine. And the mechanic wants one for himself."

---

*20 scripts. All Ray-Ban Meta POV. All real interactions with real people who don't know they're being filmed. The glasses capture what no camera crew can — genuine first reactions. Sami stays back with the wide angle for the reveal shot. The pocket bike sells itself; the glasses just catch the proof.*

### FG1. THE SHOPLIFTING

**Free gift featured:** Boat Soundbar, Cult Massager Gun, Wireless Headphones

**Hook (0-3 sec):** Black-and-white security camera angle. Grainy. Timestamp ticking in the corner. A person walks OUT of BCH carrying a massive soundbar box. Text slams on screen: "SUSPECT 1."

Shot entirely on phone with a B&W filter from a high angle (mount phone on a shelf or ladder outside the store to mimic a CCTV). Suspect 1 walks out of BCH hugging a soundbar box, looking left and right nervously. Suspect 2 walks out stuffing a massager gun into a bag. Suspect 3 walks out wearing wireless headphones, speed-walking away. It looks like a ROBBERY in progress. Each one gets a "SUSPECT" label. Then — COLOUR kicks in. Wide shot of the BCH entrance. Staff member standing there, SMILING, casually handing out items to every customer who walks out with a cycle. Text: "It's not theft. It's free." Staff waves at the camera. "Every weekend. Just walk in."

---

### FG2. THE CUSTOMS CHECKPOINT ✅ APPROVED

**Free gift featured:** Oven Toaster Griller

Shot at BCH store entrance. Kid walks out of BCH carrying a bag. Mom is standing at the store exit holding a cricket bat like a security wand. She runs the bat up and down past the kid — edited BEEP sound on every pass. "Anything to declare?" Kid: "One e-cycle." Mom checks it off. Bat passes the bag — LOUD BEEP. "What's in the bag?" Kid freezes. Mom opens the bag herself. Pulls out the OTG. Holds it up like it's contraband. "A TOASTER GRILLER? From a CYCLE STORE?" Kid: "It was free, Ma." Mom, suspicious: "Turn around. Hands on the wall." Frisks his pockets with the bat — BEEP BEEP BEEP. Finds the receipt. Reads it. The receipt confirms: Free gift. Mom, quietly: "Okay, you may exit. But the toaster stays with me."

Every weekend. Just walk in.

---

### FG3. THE LUNCH LADY

**Free gift featured:** Multiple items (use whatever's in stock)

**Hook (0-3 sec):** BCH staff member standing at the store exit SLAPS a massager gun into a customer's hands. Hard. Fast. No eye contact. Like a school lunch lady slamming food on a tray.

Staff member at the BCH exit with a trolley of free gifts. Customer 1 walks out with cycle — SLAP, headphones in hand. Customer doesn't even process it, keeps walking. Customer 2 — SLAP, foot massager. Customer 3 — SLAP, OTG. The rhythm is the content. No words. Just the mechanical SLAP-SLAP-SLAP. Each customer looks down at what they just received, confused, but keeps walking because the next person is already coming. By customer 5, the staff member is sweating from the pace. Customer 6 stops: "Bhai, yeh kya hai?" Staff, without looking up: "Free gift. NEXT." The conveyor belt energy at a CYCLE STORE is the joke.

Every weekend. Just walk in.

---

### FG4. THE LINEUP

**Free gift featured:** OTG, Massager Gun, Headphones, Soundbar, Boxing Gloves

**Hook (0-3 sec):** 5 people standing against the BCH store wall. Arms at their sides. Each holding a completely different random item. It looks like a police lineup outside a cycle store.

Shot outside BCH. 5 real customers lined up against the store wall (get them to participate after purchase). Each holding their free gift — one has an OTG, one has a massager gun, one has headphones, one has a soundbar box, one has boxing gloves. Staff member walks in front of them holding a phone like a clipboard. Points at customer 1: "What did you come here to buy?" "A cycle." "What are you holding?" "...a toaster." Points at customer 2: "What did you buy?" "A cycle." "What are you holding?" "...a massage gun." By customer 5 (boxing gloves), the staff member looks at the camera: "I work at a CYCLE store. Someone explain this to me." All 5 customers shrug in unison.

Every weekend. Just walk in.

---

### FG5. THE TROPHY WALK

**Free gift featured:** Boat Aavante Soundbar

**Hook (0-3 sec):** A customer walks out of BCH, LIFTS a soundbar box above his head with both hands like a World Cup trophy. Staff on both sides CHEERING.

Customer steps out of BCH's entrance onto the footpath. The SECOND he clears the door, he HOISTS the soundbar box over his head. 2-3 staff members flank him, clapping and cheering like he just scored the winning goal. He walks down the footpath in slow motion, soundbar overhead, face dead serious. A passerby on the street stops. "Kya jeeta?" (What did you win?) Customer, still walking, still holding it up: "Cycle kharida. Yeh free mila." Passerby looks at the soundbar. Looks at the BCH sign. Looks back at the soundbar. Starts walking toward the store. The trophy walk continues down the street.

Every weekend. Just walk in.

---

### FG6. THE REVERSE HEIST

**Free gift featured:** Cult Massager Gun (Big)

**Hook (0-3 sec):** A customer walks out of BCH with his cycle, trying to leave quietly. A staff member SPRINTS out after him. "SIR! SIR! STOP!"

The customer freezes. Turns around slowly. Thinks he's in trouble. Staff member catches up, panting. "Sir... you forgot something." Reaches into a bag. Pulls out a massager gun. Hands it over. "It's free. With the cycle." Customer, relieved and confused: "You... CHASED me... to give me something FREE?" Staff, catching breath: "Yes sir. We don't let anyone leave without their gift." Customer looks at the massager gun. Looks at the staff. Looks at his cycle. Takes one step. Staff: "SIR!" Customer jumps. Staff: "Have a good day." Customer walks away fast, clutching the massager gun, looking back every 3 seconds.

Every weekend. Just walk in.

---

### FG7. THE REAL REACTION

**Free gift featured:** Any item (use whatever gets the best reaction)

**Hook (0-3 sec):** Tight close-up on a real customer's FACE the exact moment they're told they're getting a free gift. The genuine "wait WHAT?" face. You cannot script this.

Hidden camera angle inside BCH. Staff finishes billing a real customer's e-cycle. "Sir, one more thing." Reaches under the counter. Pulls out a soundbar (or whatever item). "This is also yours. Free." Camera stays LOCKED on the customer's face. The 2-second processing delay. The eyebrows. The look at the item. The look at the staff. The look back at the item. "Free?" "Free." Customer turns to whoever they came with. "DID YOU HEAR THAT?" The companion: "From a CYCLE store?!" Shoot 4-5 real customers in a row, rapid cuts of different faces reacting. Each one funnier than the last. The genuine confusion IS the content. End on the best reaction.

Every weekend. Just walk in.

---

### FG8. THE DONATION TABLE

**Free gift featured:** All available items

**Hook (0-3 sec):** A table on the footpath outside BCH. On it: massager guns, OTGs, headphones, soundbar, boxing gloves. A handwritten sign: "FREE. NOT A JOKE." Passersby slowing down, confused.

Set up a table right outside BCH's entrance with ALL the free gifts displayed. Big cardboard sign: "FREE. NOT A JOKE." Passersby stop. One picks up the soundbar: "This is really free?" Staff: "Buy a cycle inside, pick one of these." Person laughs: "Yeah right." Staff: "Sir, I'm serious." Person looks at the items. Looks at the store. Looks at the prices. Another passerby picks up the massager gun: "Bhai, yeh kya scam hai?" Staff, deadpan: "No scam sir. Cycle + free gift. Every weekend." People start crowding the table. Examining items. Whispering to each other. Someone walks into the store. Walks out 20 minutes later. Takes an OTG from the table. The remaining people on the footpath watch him leave. One of them says: "I was just passing by. Now I need a cycle."

Every weekend. Just walk in.

---

### FG9. THE TUG OF WAR

**Free gift featured:** Cult Massager Gun

**Hook (0-3 sec):** Two customers outside BCH, BOTH gripping the same massager gun box from opposite ends. Pulling. Neither letting go.

Shot on the footpath right outside BCH. Two customers who both just bought cycles. Staff hands one of them a massager gun. The other one sees it: "Wait, I didn't get one?" Staff: "Sir, yours is the headphones." Customer 2: "I don't WANT headphones. I want THAT." Grabs the massager gun box. Tug of war begins. Both pulling. Staff in the middle trying to separate them: "GENTLEMEN! THERE ARE MORE INSIDE!" They don't hear. They're locked in. A third customer walks out, sees the fight, quietly picks up the headphones from the counter, and slips away unnoticed. Staff finally pulls them apart, gives each one a massager gun. They shake hands. Staff, wiping sweat: "I sell CYCLES. Why am I breaking up fights over MASSAGER GUNS?"

Every weekend. Just walk in.

### FG10. THE RED CARPET EXIT

**Free gift featured:** Prestige Mixer Grinder

**Hook (0-3 sec):** A red cloth rolled out from BCH's entrance onto the footpath. A customer walks out ON the red carpet, holding a mixer grinder above his head. Staff on both sides doing slow claps.

Roll out a red cloth (or any fabric) from the store entrance to the footpath. Customer steps out holding his e-cycle receipt in one hand and a Prestige mixer grinder in the other. Staff members line both sides, doing exaggerated slow claps. One staff member speaks into his phone like a mic: "And coming out of the store today, having purchased ONE e-cycle, he is also the proud new owner of a PRESTIGE MIXER GRINDER. A round of applause, ladies and gentlemen." The customer strikes a pose with the mixer grinder. Passerby walks through the shot: "Bhai, shaadi hai ya cycle shop?" (Is this a wedding or a cycle shop?) Staff: "Neither, sir. It's a WEEKEND."

Every weekend. Just walk in.

### FG11. THE BOXING REVEAL

**Free gift featured:** Elite Boxing Gloves + Bag

**Hook (0-3 sec):** A customer walks out of BCH wearing BOXING GLOVES. Throws a jab-jab-cross combo into the air outside a CYCLE STORE. Passersby flinch.

Customer walks out of BCH, boxing gloves ON, punching bag under one arm, e-cycle receipt between his teeth. He stops on the footpath. Throws a full combo — jab, jab, cross, uppercut — at the air. A guy walking past DUCKS. "BHAI! Kya kar raha hai?!" Customer, still bouncing on his toes: "BCH gave me free boxing gloves with my cycle." Guy: "Cycle shop mein boxing gloves?" Customer, still jabbing: "BHAI I DON'T KNOW. But I feel ALIVE." Starts shadowboxing down the street. Staff watching from the entrance, arms crossed. Shakes head. Looks at camera: "I just wanted to sell cycles." Another customer walks out, tries on the gloves, and joins the shadowboxing.

Every weekend. Just walk in.

### FG12. THE STACKING

**Free gift featured:** Multiple items stacking up

**Hook (0-3 sec):** Customer 1 walks out of BCH carrying an e-cycle + a headphone box. Customer 2 walks out carrying an e-cycle + a headphone box + a massager gun. Customer 3 walks out with an even TALLER stack. Each one more overloaded than the last.

Shot from across the street, fixed camera. Customer 1 exits BCH: cycle in one hand, headphone box in the other. Fine. Customer 2 exits: cycle, OTG box balanced on the seat, bag hanging from handlebar. Getting wobbly. Customer 3 exits: cycle, soundbar box on the seat, massager gun tucked under arm, bag on back. Struggling. Customer 4 exits: cycle completely invisible under a MOUNTAIN of free gift boxes, only his feet visible underneath. He can't see where he's going. Staff runs out: "SIR! SIR! That's one gift per person! You took FIVE!" Customer 4's voice from under the pile: "I bought five cycles!" Staff pauses. "...carry on."

Every weekend. Just walk in.

*12 concepts. ALL shot at BCH store + footpath. No home setups. Every hook is physical or visually confusing in the first 3 seconds. Real customers and staff. The free gift is always the punchline, never the lead. The viewer stops because something looks WRONG — theft at a cycle store, boxing outside a shop, a red carpet on a footpath, customers fighting over massager guns. Every single one ends the same way: Every weekend. Just walk in.*
